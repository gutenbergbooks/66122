CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
LILIAN.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I love thee, gentle Knight! but 'tis,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such love as sisters bear;<br />
  O, ask my heart no more than this,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more it may not spare.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KNIGHT TOGGENBURG.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The image of Clermistonlee and his threats
came painfully upon Lilian's memory.  She
shrieked for aid, but her cries were lost in the
vacuity of the old-fashioned coach in which she
was being carried off.  She strove to open the
windows, but they were immoveable as those of
a castle, and she resigned herself to tears and
despair.  The vehicle was rumbling and jolting
over a waste of frozen snow; here and there, a
farm-house or a congealed rivulet were passed,
but everything appeared so strange and new, when
viewed in their snowy guise by the twilight of the
mirky winter night, that Lilian had not the most
remote idea in what direction she was taken; and,
shuddering with cold and apprehension, the poor
girl crouched down in a corner of the coach, and
abandoned herself to grief and wretchedness.
</p>

<p>
The excessive chill of the night, and prostration
of spirit under which she laboured, produced a
sort of stupor, and when the coach stopped, she
was unable to move; but a tall dark man, muffled
and masked like an intriguing gallant of the day,
lifted her out.  As one in a dream, who would in
vain elude some hideous vision, she attempted to
shriek; but the unuttered cry died away on her
lips, and she closed her eyes.  A strong embrace
encircled her; a hot breath&mdash;(was it not a
kiss?)&mdash;came upon her cold cheek, and she felt herself
borne along; doors closed behind her, and by the
warmth of the altered temperature she was aware
of being within a house.
</p>

<p>
She was seated gently in a chair; and now she
looked around her.  A large fire of roots was
blazing on the rough stone-hearth; its ruddy glow
rendered yet more red the bare walls and strongly
arched roof of a hall (built of red sandstone) such
as may be seen in the old fortlets of the lesser
barons of Scotland.  The windows on each side
were deeply embayed by the thickness of the wall,
and a deep-browed arch spanned each; they had
stone seats covered with crimson cushions, and
foot-mats of plaited rushes.
</p>

<p>
The hurrying clouds and occasional stars were
seen through the strong basket-gratings that
externally defended these prison-like apertures.  The
hall was paved, and its rude massive furniture
consisted only of a great oblong table of oak, several
forms or settles, a few high-backed chairs, and one
upon a raised part of the floor, at the upper end,
had a canopy of crimson cloth over it, announcing
that it was the state-chair of the Lord of the Manor.
Swords, pikes, harquebuses, hunting and hawking
appurtenances, with a few veiled pictures, were
among its ornaments.
</p>

<p>
A great almery, or cupboard (so called from the
old hospitable custom of setting aside food as <i>alms</i>
for the poor), occupied one end of the apartment,
and an ancient casque surmounted it.  Various
bunkers of carved oak, bound with iron, occupied
the other.  On the right hand of the doorway, a
stone lavatory, covered with magnificent sculpture
projected from the wall.  This old-fashioned bason
was furnished with a hole to carry off water, and
was an indispensable convenience to every ancient
dining-hall.
</p>

<p>
With one rapid glance of terror Lilian surveyed
the whole place, and started from her chair to be
confronted by one whose aspect made her instinctively
shrink back.  The keen and hawk-like eyes
of Beatrix Gilruth were fixed upon her with an
expression at once menacing, searching, and
scornful.  There was something in the wild visage
of this inexplicable woman that excited curiosity,
while her air terrified, and her withered person
repelled approach.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, woman?" asked Lilian firmly,
as, stepping back a pace, she surveyed her from
head to foot; "and what are you?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>What</i> am I?" reiterated the other, with a voice
that thrilled, while her grey eyes gleamed with a
blue light, and she ground her teeth.  "I am
what thou shalt be, my pretty minx, ere ye leave
these walls, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
Lilian, terrified by her aspect and her answer,
sank into a chair, saying, as she clasped her
hands, and looked up imploringly from her bright
dishevelled hair&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Woman, for the love of God, say where am I?"
</p>

<p>
"In the tower of Clermistonlee."
</p>

<p>
"So my soul foreboded; but can <i>he</i> have dared
thus far?"
</p>

<p>
"What will he not dare that man can do?"
</p>

<p>
"O Heaven, protect me!"
</p>

<p>
"Neither the Heaven that is above us, nor the
Hell that is beneath, will protect you, pretty one;
but you will be made what many as fair have been,&mdash;the
toy, the plaything of an hour, to be cast aside
when some new fancy has seized the wayward
mind of your lord and betrayer.  Look at that
veiled portrait&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At that moment three distinct knocks were
heard against the almery.  Lilian started and
turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said Beatrix scornfully, addressing
the knocker; "you are impatient.  There was a
time&mdash;but it matters not&mdash;I bide mine; and my
long delayed vengeance will wither thee up, false
lord, even as if the lightning of God had scorched
thy perjured soul."
</p>

<p>
Low as this was uttered, it reached the ears of
Lilian; she became doubly terrified, and a
momentary feeling of utter abandonment made her
cover her face with her hands and weep bitterly.
But, suddenly starting up, she said with energy&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I will go hence, madam; and whatever be the
danger, I will risk it.  But the snow, the
darkness, and the distance&mdash;oh, horror!&mdash;Aunt
Grisel&mdash;gossip Annie&mdash;what will they think of
this?&mdash;what will become of me?"
</p>

<p>
"Stand," said Beatrix, interposing.  "Are you
mad, to think of leaving this roof in the middle of
a winter night?  Remember the dreary lea of
Clermiston, the rocks and the frozen marshes of
Corstorphine, you are fey, maiden, to think it."
</p>

<p>
"Begone, thou ill woman," replied Lilian
contemptuously; "I will go, and I dare thee to stay
me."
</p>

<p>
"Then," rejoined Beatrix spitefully, "remember
the barred windows, the bolted gates, and the
good stone walls.  Pooh, maiden, take tent and
bide where ye are; for I swear ye can never go
from hence, but at the pleasure of my lord."
</p>

<p>
"Insolent!  Know ye who I am?" asked Lilian.
</p>

<p>
"The young lady of Bruntisfield," answered
Beatrix coldly; "a wayward lass with a braw
tocher, it seemeth,&mdash;one who prefers a younger
cap and feather than my lord.  Ha! hath he not
sworn&mdash;(and mark me, maiden, he never swears in
vain!)&mdash;that he will compel thee yet to beg his
love at his hand as a boon, even as humbly as he
now sues thine."
</p>

<p>
"In sooth!" retorted Lilian, with angry surprise.
"He will surely have the aid of some such
witch as thee to work so modern a miracle."
</p>

<p>
"Witch, quotha!" replied Beatrix, whose
withered cheek began to redden with passion.
"Lilian Napier, there was a time when these grey
grizzled locks were once as bright and as glossy as
thine; when this brow was as smooth, this faded
form as round, yea, and as beautiful; this step as
light, and this poor face as fair, as thine now are.
So beware thee of taunts, maiden; for the time is
coming (if thou art spared) when thou mayest be
loathsome as I now am, and loathing as I now do.
That hour is coming; for Clermistonlee hath an
evil eye, beneath whose baleful influence all that
is good and beautiful in woman will wither and
die.  Oh!  Lilian Napier, what a tale of love and
weakness, shame and misery, sin and horror, would
the history of my life reveal!  But my hour of
revenge is coming.  Yes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Again three knocks louder than before rang on
the almery; and Beatrix, trembling, ceased to
talk, and busied herself in laying a supper on the
hall-table.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Walter!  Walter!" murmured Lilian, "if
you knew of this&mdash;if you were here to protect
me!"  Her tears flowed freely.
</p>

<p>
"Walter!" reiterated Beatrix musing; "can it
really be the same?  No, it is impossible; and
yet, why not?&mdash;He is your lover, then, this
Walter?" she asked in a low voice, while laying
some cold grilled meat, confections, and wine from
a buffet.  "I know he is&mdash;that blush tells me
(when did my cheek blush last?)  He is young and
handsome, I warrant?"
</p>

<p>
Lilian nodded an affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"And men say he is brave?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! brave as a hero of romance," said
Lilian in the same low tone; for there is nothing
so pleasing to love as to hear the object of it
praised.  "And so noble&mdash;so generous!  If true
worth gave a title, my dear Walter would be a
belted Earl."
</p>

<p>
"Instead of being a poor standard-bearer in the
ranks of Dunbarton."
</p>

<p>
"You have seen him then?" said Lilian, her
blue eyes beaming, as she almost forgot her
present predicament in the thought of her lover.
"Is he not handsome, good woman?"
</p>

<p>
"It is the same!" exclaimed Beatrix, in her
shrillest tone.  "Walter, the powder-boy&mdash;the
soldier's brat&mdash;hah!"&mdash;she ground her teeth, and
clenched her shrivelled hands like knots of
serpents&mdash;"I bide my time.  Oh, I will be fearfully
avenged!"
</p>

<p>
A third time there was a knocking on the
almery, and Beatrix muttered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am dumb&mdash;I will speak no more."
</p>

<p>
She pointed to the supper-table, and, throwing
herself into a chair, fixed her sunken eyes upon
the red glowing fire, and, lost in her own wild
thoughts, continued to jabber with the rapidity
and restlessness of insanity.  It was evident that
she was partly deranged,&mdash;a discovery which,
while it raised the pity of the gentle Lilian,
increased the dread and the horror of her situation.
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee, with his faithful rascal Juden,
were both within earshot.  The former had sufficient
tact and experience to know that it would be
better to defer any interview with Lilian until
next morning, by which time he hoped she would
be a little more familiarised with her situation;
and leaving Juden, who was ensconced in the
recesses of the almery, to be a check upon the
troublesome garrulity of his only female domestic, he
retired to a snug apartment, where, enveloped in
his shag dressing-gown, and comforted by a great
tankard of his favourite mulled sack, and several
books of "ungodly jests," he practised all his
philosophy to enable him to endure this temporary
separation from Lilian, consoled by the idea that
she was completely in his clutches, within his
strong tower, which he was entitled to defend
against all men living; and well aware that, in the
political storm which in another week would
convulse all Scotland from the Cheviots to Cape
Wrath, the abduction of a girl&mdash;more especially
the daughter of a "persecuting cavalier"&mdash;would
be less regarded than the wind blowing over the
muir.
</p>

<p>
As the still, quiet night wore on, and the fumes
of the wine mounted into his head, very strange
ideas floated through the brain of the roué.  Again
and again the thought of Lilian being so utterly
in his power intruded itself upon his heated
imagination; he felt his blood begin to glow; his
mind became confused; he endeavoured to combat
his constitutional wickedness, and, by aid of his
repeated potations, and a highly seasoned grillade,
dozed away the night very comfortably in a
well-cushioned chair; while his leal henchman was
in the same happy state of oblivion, through the
medium of various stoups of ale which he imbibed
in the spence or buttery.
</p>

<p>
Not so did poor Lilian pass the slow and heavy
hours.
</p>

<p>
The repast prepared for her was left untouched,
she resisted every invitation to repose, and
resolved on passing the night by the hall-fire;
until, reflecting that she would be quite as safe in
one part of the tower as in another, and wishing
to be alone, that she might weep unseen, she was
ushered by Beatrix up a narrow stair into a little
sleeping apartment, the greater part of which was
occupied by a great hearse-looking tester, or
canopy bed.  The only light in the chamber came
from the fire-place, where a heap of logs and coals
were blazing, and diffusing a warm glow on the
dark wainscotted walls, the oaken floor, and rude
ceiling, which was crossed by a massive dormant-tree
of oak, covered with grotesque and hideous
carving.
</p>

<p>
There was something very gloomy and catafalcque-like
in the aspect of the gigantic bed in
which Lilian was to repose; its massive posts of
dark oak and darker ebony were covered embossage,
and the deep crimson curtains, with heavy
fringes, fell in shadowy festoons, while four great
plumes of feathers surmounted the corners in
sepulchral grandeur.  It stood upon a raised dais
of three steps, and on the back, amid a wilderness
of bassi-relievi, flowers, angels, satyrs, and ivy,
appeared the coronet and gorgeous blazon of
Clermistonlee.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot sleep here, good woman," said Lilian
shuddering; but the noise of the closing door, and
the bolt jarring outside, was her only reply.  She
found herself alone.  Her first impulse was to
fasten her door within securely; her second to
examine the chamber, by the light of the fire.  In
the deep little window stood a beautiful cabinet,
on the upper part of which were a mirror and all
the usual appurtenances for a lady's toilet, but of
the most costly and elegant description, with all
the perfumes, oils, essences and lotions then most
in vogue.  She turned from them with disgust to
survey the walls, for the fear of secret entrances
was impressed powerfully upon her mind by her
knowledge of the number that existed in her own
home; but, upon examination, she found nothing
to increase her dread, save the cabinet, the doors
of which were locked, and returned an unusually
hollow sound when she touched them.
</p>

<p>
Alternately a prey to fear and indignation, she
walked about the little apartment, or sat by the
fire weeping and praying, until sleep began to
oppress her; and, unable longer to resist its effects,
with an audible supplication to Heaven that the
morrow might bring about her release, she threw
herself (without undressing) on the bed, and
almost immediately fell fast asleep.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
HOW CLERMISTONLEE PRESSED HIS SUIT.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
A strong dose of love is worse than one of ratafia; when once it
gets into our heads it trips up our heels, and then good night to
discretion.  THE LYING VALET.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From an uneasy slumber that had been disturbed
by many a painful dream, Lilian started,
awoke, and leaped from the bed.  The embers of
the night fire still smouldered on the hearth stone,
and the rays of the red sun rising above a gorge
in the Corstorphine hills, radiated through her
grated window as through a focus.  Pressing her
hands upon her temples, she endeavoured to
collect the scattered images that had haunted her
sleep.  She had dreamt of Walter.  He seemed
to be present in that very chamber, to stand by
her gloomy bed, and smiled kindly and fondly as
of old.  He bent over to kiss her, but lo! his
features turned to those of Lord Clermistonlee;
the great tester bed with its plumage and canopy
became a hearse; she screamed and awoke to find
it was day.
</p>

<p>
Now all her former fear and indignation revived
in full force, and she wept passionately.
Reflecting how completely she was at the mercy
of Clermistonlee, whose character for reckless
ferocity, and steady obstinacy of purpose, she
knew too well; she resolved to endure with
patience, and await with caution an opportunity
for release or escape.  How little she knew of
what was acting in Edinburgh!  And her beloved
kinswoman, so revered, so tender, and affectionate,
but so aged and infirm.
</p>

<p>
"O horror!" exclaimed Lilian, wringing her
hands, "this must have destroyed her."
</p>

<p>
"Open Madam Lilian," said the voice of Beatrix
Gilruth, as she knocked at the door; "open,
my lord awaits you at breakfast in the hall."
</p>

<p>
Lilian hesitated; but aware that resistance
would not better her fortune, with her usual
frankness ran to the door, opened it, and despite
the repulsive sternness of Gilruth's aspect,
impelled by a sense of loneliness, and a wish to
gain her friendship, she bade her good morning,
and lightly touched her hand.  Her air of
innocence and candour impressed the misanthropic
heart of Beatrix, and she smiled kindly.  While
leading her before the mirror to assist in arraying
her for breakfast, the bosom of the unfortunate
castaway could not repress a sigh, and a scanty
tear trembled in either eye, as she writhed her
withered fingers in the soft masses of Lilian's
hair.
</p>

<p>
"I will shew thee my bairn what a braw
busker I am," said Beatrix, "though 'tis long
since these poor fingers have had aught to do
with top-knots and fantanges."
</p>

<p>
Resigned and careless of what was done with
her, Lilian remained with a pale face of placid
composure and grief, gazing unconsciously upon
her own beautiful image as reflected in the
polished mirror; and though she marked it not,
there was a vivid and terrible contrast between
her statue-like features, and those of her
tire-woman&mdash;keen, attenuated, and graven with the
lines of sorrow, rage, bitterness, and misanthropy;
the true index of that storm of evil passions and
resentful thoughts that smouldered in her heart.
</p>

<p>
At length the captive was arrayed so far as the
skill of Beatrix would go; her dress (that in which
she had left home) was long, flowing, and heavily
flounced in the French fashion, derived from
Albert Durer, who represented an angel in
flounced petticoats expelling Adam and Eve from
Paradise&mdash;hence flounces were all the rage.  She
wore long and heavy ruffles of the richest lace, a
string of pearls and amber was twisted among the
bright braids of her beautiful hair; a diamond
drop depended from each of her delicate ears,
and a rich necklace like a collar, with a pendant,
encircled her neck, the whiteness and purity of
which never appeared in greater splendour, than
when contrasted with the faded skin of poor
Beatrix.  Passive under her hands, Lilian allowed
her great natural beauty to be thus dangerously
enhanced, and when she stood up, her rather
diminutive stature being increased by her high
heeled maroquin shoes, and the grace with which
she wore her commode and floating flounces,
caused the poor woman, whom so many fair ones
had successively supplanted, to utter an
exclamation of delight.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said she, "my lord awaits you; how
pleased he will be."
</p>

<p>
"Oh my God!" exclaimed Lilian, in deep
anguish; "and was it to please him you have thus
arrayed and attired me.  Fie upon thee, ill
woman!"
</p>

<p>
"Here at least his bidding must be obeyed
implicitly, as when a hundred of his men stabled
their horses in the barbican stalls.  He is a
dangerous man, hinny, and never tholed thwarting,
though the hour is coming when he shall thole
bitter vengeance, and dree the deepest remorse.
But I bide my time&mdash;I bide my time."
</p>

<p>
As she led Lilian into the hall, Clermistonlee
advanced to receive her, with an imperturbable
air of assurance, gallantry, and devotion.  Through
one of the deeply recessed windows, the light
of the morning sun fell full upon his noble
face and figure, which the richness of his
dress displayed to the utmost advantage.  He
wore an embroidered suit of light blue satin
slashed with white; he had round his neck the
gold collar of the thistle, and had over his left
breast the green ribbon and oval badge of the
order; a diamond hilted rapier sparkled in a
baldrick that was stiff with gold embroidery; his
flowing peruke was redolent of perfume; his
ruffles were miracles of needlework, and his
brilliant sleeve buttons flashed whenever his hands
moved.
</p>

<p>
Hateful as he was at all times to Lilian, now
he was more so than ever; surprise, indignation,
fear, and contempt, agitated her by turns, and she
gazed on him in painful suspense, awaiting his
address.  He had evidently made his toilet with
more than usual care, and resolving to give
Lilian no time for reproaches, he led her at once
to a seat, saying,
</p>

<p>
"My dear girl will no doubt be in a prodigious
passion with me, but ladies are kindly disposed to
forgive every little mistake that has love for its
excuse.  'Tis but a dismal old peelhouse this,
dear Lilian, but I hope you slept well.  The
wind sings in the corridors, the corbies scream on
the roof, and all that, but with a clear conscience
you know, oh yes, one may dose like a top, or a
lord of session.
</p>

<p>
"A clear sharp morning this; I rode as far as
Craigroyston before sunrise.  There is nothing so
improves one's complexion as a gallop in the
morning air.  Apropos! what do you think of
this embroidered suit?  'Tis the last fashion from
Paris; that old villain Saunders Snip, in the
Craimes, brought it direct from thence last
month.  On a good figure it is quite calculated
to make an impression.  Look'ee, fair Lilian;
these ruffles cost me twenty guineas a pair, not a
tester less I assure you; and the sleeve buttons
are the first of their kind, and were made by
Monsieur Bütong, the eminent Parisian jeweller,
for that glorious fop, the Comte d'Artois, who
presented them to a friend of mine in the Scots
Archers.
</p>

<p>
"But this tie of my overlay, ha! that is a
contrivance of my own; graceful, is it not?
exactly&mdash;I knew you would think so.  Droll, is
it not, that our tastes should be the same?  You
see, my dear girl, at what trouble I have been to
please you.  Smile again, dear Lilian," continued
his lordship, whose overnight potations, the
morning ride had failed quite to dispel; "by Heaven,
you look divine: where shall I find words to
compliment the beauty of your appearance this
morning!"
</p>

<p>
"You really seem to require all your verbosity
for praising yourself, my lord," said Lilian,
coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Now&mdash;now, do not be so angry," said Clermistonlee,
taking her hand in spite of all her
efforts to prevent him.
</p>

<p>
"I am justly so, my lord," replied Lilian
making a strong effort to restrain her tears under
an aspect of firmness and determination.  "By
what right have you dared to bring me here and
detain me prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
"Hoity, toity&mdash;right dear Lilian? the right of
a most devoted lover."
</p>

<p>
"My lord, you will be severely punished for
this.  The law&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!  Lilian, there is no law now, no
order, morality, nor any thing else.  The world
is turned upside down, (at least Britain
is)&mdash;revolutionized, bewildered, and the old days of battle
and broil, reiving and rugging, have come back in
all their glory.  In this desperate game, my girl,"
he added, through his clenched teeth, "Clermistonlee
must repair his fortune or be lost for ever;
but enough of this; let us to breakfast, and then
we will talk over matters that lie nearer our hearts.
Nay, nay, no refusal&mdash;breakfast you must have."
</p>

<p>
He led her towards the long hall table, where,
thanks to Juden's catering and ingenuity, a noble
repast was laid, in the profuse "style of ancient
gourmandizing; and the unscrupulous factotum
who stood near with a napkin under his arm, and
a long corkscrew in his hand, surveyed Lilian
with something between a smirk and a leer, which
was sufficient to increase the fear that oppressed,
and the anger that swelled within her breast.
She withdrew, saying, with a voice that trembled
between indignation and apprehension,
</p>

<p>
"Spare me this continued humiliation.  Oh
my Lord Clermistonlee, if there remain within
your breast, one spark of that bright spirit which
ought ever to be the guiding star of the noble and
the gentleman, you will restore me to my home,
to the only relative (save one) whom death has
left me in this wide world.  Be generous, my
lord," continued Lilian, touching his hand, with
charming frankness; "Oh be generous, as I know
you are brave and reckless.  Restore me to my
home, and I pledge my word you will never be
questioned concerning my abduction.  I will pass
it over as a foolish but daring frolic.  Hear me,
my lord, in pity hear me."
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee trembled beneath her gentle
touch; but answered with his usual air of raillery,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hoity, toity, little one! art going to read me
curtain lectures already?  My dear Lilian, it is
too bad really!  The abduction?  Oh the ardour
of my love will be a sufficient excuse for that;
and as to being questioned&mdash;I don't think any
person will permit himself to question me, if he
remembers that I am the best hand at pistol,
rapier, and dagger, in broad Scotland.
</p>

<p>
"Beside, dear Lilian, (why dost always shrink? dost
think child I am going to eat thee like a
rascally ogre) if thou wouldst save thine honour,"
here his voice sank involuntarily into an
impressive whisper, "become mine.  Thou shouldst
be well aware that after living in the power of
one who is so tremendous a roué by habit and
repute, no woman could go forth into the world
without lying under suspicions of a very unpleasant
nature.  The roisters at Blair's coffee house
have got hold of the story, for it hath made a
devil of a noise in the city, and in the mouths of
the Bowhead gossips, and Bess Wynd scandal-mongers,
our little affair will be quite a romance."
</p>

<p>
This cruel speech, which was uttered with the
utmost coolness and deliberation by Clermistonlee,
who played the while with his gold sword-knot,
came like ice upon the heart of the unhappy
Lilian, who could not but secretly acknowledge
that it was too true.  She grew pale as death, and,
unable to reply, gazed upon her tormentor with a
look of such intense aversion, that he could not
repress a haughty smile of astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha! for what do you take me?"
</p>

<p>
"For a monster!" murmured Lilian, in a voice
almost inarticulate.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;oh! you regard me as a poor sparrow
doth a gerfalcon."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" said Lilian, weeping as she sank into
a seat, "the simile is but too true."
</p>

<p>
"You are very unpolite, Madam Lilian; a
gerfalcon is between the vulture and the hawk."
</p>

<p>
Lilian answered only by her tears, and his
lordship began to get a little provoked.
</p>

<p>
"A devil of a breakfast this, my pretty
moppet," he continued, with an air of composure;
"when these vapours have passed away, peradventure
you will condescend to hear my addresses&mdash;meantime
consider yourself quite at home, and
for Heaven's sake (or rather your own), do take a
share of such humble cheer as this my poor house
of Clermiston affords."  And without troubling
her farther, he threw back the curls of his peruke,
and attacked the devilled duck, the cold sirloin,
and wassail-bowl of spiced ale, the smoking coffee
and hot bannocks forthwith.
</p>

<p>
Within the recess of a window, reclined upon
the cushion of one of those stone side-seats so
common in old Scottish towers, Lilian sat with
her face covered with her hands, and shaded by
the masses of her fine hair which fell forward over
her drooping head.  The glory of the red morning
sun streamed full upon her tresses and turned
them to wreaths of gold.  She seemed something
etherially beautiful, and the sensual lord felt his
heart beat with increased ardour as he gazed on
her from time to time; but aware, from old experience,
that it was useless to press her to partake
of his luxurious breakfast, he resolved to trouble
her no more until the first paroxism of her
indignation had evaporated.
</p>

<p>
Juden and Beatrix having finished their luggies
of porridge and ale at the lower and uncovered
part of the table, were now engaged, the former
in making lures of feathers and raw meat to train
two young hawks that sat near him on a perch,
with their long lunes or leashes coiled round it;
and the latter, while affecting to occupy herself
with some household matter, from the bay of an
opposite window, watched with a keen, restless,
and often malicious expression, the nonchalant
lord and the unhappy Lilian, for whom, at times,
she felt something akin to pity, and fain would
have set her at liberty; but the keys of the tower
gates were buckled to Juden's girdle, and every
window was closed by a grating like a strong iron
harrow.
</p>

<p>
In the faint hope of some rescue approaching,
Lilian gazed earnestly from the window she
occupied.  It faced the south, and overlooked the
then dreary waste of Clermiston Lee, which, with
all the undulating country extending to the base
of the Pentlands, and that gigantic range,
towering peak above peak, as they diminished in the
western shire of Linlithgow, were covered with
one universal mantle of dazzling snow.  Afar off
above the hills of Braid the level sun poured its
red rays through a hazy sky across the desolate
landscape; the thickets, bare and leafless, stood
like cypress groves in the waste; the dim winter
smoke from many farm-house and cottage lum of
clay, ascended in murky columns into the frosty
air, but around the lonely tower on the Lee, there
was an aspect of stillness and desolation that
struck a chill upon Lilian's heart.
</p>

<p>
Far off, on the Glasgow road, that passed the
picturesque old church, the thatched hamlet and
Foresters' Castle of Corstorphine, a strong square
fortress flanked by round towers, a solitary
traveller, muffled in his furred rocquelaure and
leathern gambadoes, or grey maud and worsted
galligaskins (according to his rank), spurred his
horse towards the city; but such occasional passers
were all beyond the reach of Lilian.  The bridle-road
to the town was hidden, and not a foot-print
stained the spotless mantle of the level Lee.  At
times a hare or fox shot across it, from the woods
or rocks of Corstorphine, but no other living thing
approached, and the heart of poor Lilian grew
more and more sad as the dreary day wore on, and
night once more approached.

CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
CLAVERHOUSE TO THE RESCUE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The winter cold is past and gone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now comes on the spring;<br />
  And I am one of the Scots Life Guards,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must fight for the King.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear!<br />
  And I must fight for him!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OLD SONG.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By orders from William of Orange, who had
taken possession of James's palace, and issued
from thence his sounding declarations and
imperial mandates, Goderdt de Ginckel, with the
utmost expedition, marched the captured Scots
towards London, where the Statholder (though he
had not yet been crowned) was intent on revenging,
by the lash and bullet, this signal instance of
resistance to his authority.  In consequence of this
event; he had the first "Mutiny Act" framed, but
being an edict of the English Parliament it could
in no way apply to Scottish troops.
</p>

<p>
Aware of the esprit du corps and indomitable
valour of the old musqueteers, and fearful of revolt
or rescue, de Ginckel sent Lieutenant Gavin
twenty other officers and five hundred privates, in
charge of Sir Marmaduke Langstone, direct to
London, towards which place he marched the
remainder by another route; keeping near his
person and under sure escort, Lord Dunbarton,
Walter Fenton, Finland, and other officers, whose
hostility of spirit was more undisguised than their
comrades, de Ginckel advanced some miles in
rear of the main body of his Black Horsemen.
The Earl was destined for the Tower of London;
Walter and his brothers in misfortune for the cells
of Newgate.
</p>

<p>
In every town and village through which they
were marched, dense mobs of "the rascal multitude"
attended and loaded them with every insult
and opprobrium, such as the vulgar, the cruel,
and the wicked are ever ready to hurl upon the
fallen or the unfortunate.  Marrowbones and
cleavers were clattered around them; effigies of
King James, and a figure meant to represent a
Scotchman, were carried or kicked along the
streets before them, and amid yells and hootings,
warming-pans were everywhere displayed from the
windows at their approach; at that time a famous
mode of insulting the Jacobites, being a palpable
hit against the legitimacy of the young Prince of
Wales.
</p>

<p>
"Fie upon the Scots!  Out upon thee, Mon!
No warming-pan King!  William for ever, and
down to hell with all Scots, Papists, and
Mass-mongers! hurrah!" yelled the rabble on every
hand, while vollies of mud, stones, dead cats,
&amp;c., were showered on them from every hand.
Meanwhile their Dutch escort rode on each side
with the most phlegmatic indifference, every man
seeming as if fast asleep in his voluminous breeches
and wide jack-boots.
</p>

<p>
"Down with the race of Gog&mdash;the soldiers of
the priests of Baal!" cried an old puritan; "down
with Scots Jemmy and his cursed Jesuits!"
</p>

<p>
Weak and exhausted by constant marching,
lack of food and sleep; dispirited by misfortune,
and disfigured by mud and their torn and soiled
attire; in the captives no one could have
recognized the dashing cavaliers who passed northward
a day or two before.  They had all been deprived
of their horses and arms, and been robbed of
everything of value&mdash;their cuirasses, purses, rings,
&amp;c.&mdash;by their guard.  De Ginckel was as brutal
and merciless as a Carrib Indian, and repeatedly
struck the unfortunate cavaliers with his
speaking-trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"Ach Gott!" he often cried to his Ruyters;
"if von ob de brisoners escape, ye shall answer
for him, body for body, by cast ob dice on de
kettle-trum-head!"
</p>

<p>
"My good comrades, and gallant gentlemen,"
said the Earl of Dunbarton to the little group that
marched around him, "were it not that I feel in
my heart assured that an hour of vengeance and
retribution will come, I would die of sheer spleen
and mortification, for the insults we are compelled
to put up with."
</p>

<p>
"I pity these bluff-headed Saxon boors, because
they know no better," replied Walter, staggering,
as a stone struck him on the temple; "but De
Ginckel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow," said Finland, bitterly, "'tis
a sample of the good old southern hospitality and
kindness of which we hear so much in romance,
and so little in history."
</p>

<p>
"But," continued Walter, "I despise these
poppy-headed Dutch poltroons in their black iron
doublets, and would risk my share of Heaven to
have De Ginckel under my hands on Scottish
ground, with none to interfere, and no weapons
but our rapiers and a case of good pistols."
</p>

<p>
"You speak my thoughts," said the Earl,
through his clenched teeth.  "My malediction on
Langstone and his Red Dragoons.  Had they and
such as they been good men and true, we had not
been reduced to this misfortune; and our
misguided King, instead of being a houseless fugitive,
had dwelt in Windsor still, where now the
usurping Stadtholder keeps Court and Council.  Sirs,
of a verity we live in strange times!"
</p>

<p>
As they had now crossed the Nen, had left
behind old Peterborough (with the hoary fane
where St. Oswald's bony arm worked miracles of
old), and were marching through the open country,
being free from the yells and missiles of the mob,
they could converse with tolerable freedom, though
at times De Ginckel thundered silence through
his trumpet, or a Swart Ruyter, more waggish or
wickedly inclined than his soporific comrades,
pushed his horse sidelong to tumble one of the
captives among the half-frozen mud that
encumbered the roadways.  Their mortification and
dejection increased at every step of their
retrograde march, and even the lively sallies of
Dr. Joram failed to enliven them.
</p>

<p>
The sombre evening was closing, when De
Ginckel, with his Ruyters and their captives,
after traversing the fenny district between
Cambridge and Lincoln, came in sight of Huntingdon,
where, as Dr. Joram remarked, "the devil's god-son,
that prime rascal, old Noll, first drew breath."  The
dying light of the winter sun tipped the spires
of the ancient town-hall and the church of All
Saints, and glimmered on the sluggish windings
of the Ouse.  The prisoners were pursuing a
lonely road; on one side lay a thick copsewood,
and on the other one of those wide and desolate
fens then subject to the inundations of the Ouse,
whose waters in many places formed deep and
solitary meres or tarns.  Within the recesses of
the wood, the quick eye of Walter had soon
detected the glitter of arms, to which he drew the
attention of the Earl.
</p>

<p>
"It matters not," replied the dejected noble,
"no arms now glitter under James's standard;
we are lost men, my dear lad.  It will be black
tidings for my little Lætitia, when the accursed
Tower of London holds the last Lord of Dunbarton."
</p>

<p>
"And what thinkest thou, Walter, our dear
lassies will say when they hear we are in
Newgate?" asked Finland.
</p>

<p>
"'Twill be rare news for the Lord Clermistonlee,"
replied Walter, in a fierce whisper.  "But
look, gentlemen!&mdash;behold!  In Heaven's name,
are these friends or foes?"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, a troop of horse, clad in brilliant
armour, with their white plumes waving in the
evening wind, and their long uplifted rapiers
flashing in the setting sun, and all gallantly
mounted on matchless black horses, filed forth
from the coppice, and drew up like magic on the
roadway, about a hundred yards in advance of the
Swart Ruyters, who instantly reined-up.  One
cavalier, splendidly accoutred, rode to the front,
wheeled round his snorting horse that pawed the
air, and issued his orders with stern rapidity&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen of the Scottish Guard, prepare to
charge!  Uncase the standards!  Sound trumpets!"
</p>

<p>
The banneroles were unfurled, the trumpets
sounded, the kettle-drums ruffled, and each brave
cavalier pressed forward in the saddle, as if
impatient for the order to rush to the charge.
</p>

<p>
"Ach tuyfel!" shouted De Ginckel through his
trumpet; "Scots' Horse&mdash;der tuyfel!  Sabre de
brisoners&mdash;cut dem into de towsand becies!  Fall
on, you Schelms!"  But there was no time.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Claverhouse, and the remains of his
regiment.  I would know his black steed among
a thousand horse!" exclaimed the Earl.  "Now
God be with thee, thou gallant Grahame, for at
last our hour of vengeance is come!  Oh for a
sword!  How gallantly they formed line!  Now,
now! forward, my Scottish hearts!"
</p>

<p>
The dark eyes of the proud Douglas gleamed
with fire, as the deep and distinct order,
"Cavaliers of the Life Guard&mdash;forward! <i>charge!</i>" burst
from the lips of Dundee; and with the force of
a whirlwind, the sixty Scottish Guardsmen, bridle
to bridle and boot to boot, rushed with their
uplifted swords to the onset.
</p>

<p>
"Unsling carbines&mdash;blow matches&mdash;fire!&mdash;tousand
tuyfels!&mdash;no!&mdash;traw sworts!" bellowed De
Ginckel through his trumpet, as the front rank
of his Ruyters recoiled in confusion on the rear.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, prepare to save yourselves!"
exclaimed the Earl of Dunbarton, as the Dutch
troopers cast off the cords that bound the
prisoners to their waist-belts.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven save us!" ejaculated Dr. Joram; "'tis
a perilous case this, truly!"
</p>

<p>
"To the rescue, Claverhouse!  A Grahame!
A Grahame!  God for Scotland and James VII.!
To the devil with the Stadtholder! hurrah!" cried
the Life Guards.
</p>

<p>
It was a critical moment for the dismounted
prisoners, who were hemmed in among the hostile
horsemen, and each felt his heart beat like
lightning, and his breath come thick and fast, for
death or deliverance were at hand.
</p>

<p>
Between the close files of the Swart Ruyters,
Walter Fenton saw the full rush of the advancing
troop, in their shining harness, and chief of all,
the lordly Viscount of Dundee, a lance-length in
front, with his sword brandished aloft, and his
white ostrich-feathers streaming behind him, his
cheek glowing, and his wild dark eyes flashing
with that supernatural brightness which was the
true index of his fierce and heroic spirit.  Though
the Dutch were as four to one, the Scottish
cavaliers were fearless.
</p>

<p>
There was a tremendous shock&mdash;a flashing of
swords, as their keen edges rang on the tempered
helmets and corslets of proof&mdash;a furious spurring
of horses&mdash;and Walter felt himself beaten to the
earth, as if by the force of a thunderbolt; the
light left his eyes, and he heard the voice of
Claverhouse exclaiming enthusiastically&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well done, my Scots' Life Guard!  Well
done, my berry-brown blades!"
</p>

<p>
"Come on, De Ginckel!" cried Holsterlee.
</p>

<p>
"Hand to hand, old gorbelly.  Come on! for
here are the hand and sword that shall punch a
hole in thine Earl's patent!"
</p>

<p>
A heavy hoof struck the head of Walter, as a
horse plunged over him, and the Dutch recoiled
in utter confusion.
</p>

<p>
He remembered no more.
</p>

<p>
Hewn down by the long swords of the Ruyters,
poor old Wemyss and Halbert Elshender lay dead
beside him.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Heavily and slowly passed the cloudy winter
day at Clermiston, and evening found Lilian
seated, full of tears and misery, by the great fire
that rumbled in the arched chimney, and threw a
ruddy glow on the rough architecture of the
ancient hall.  According to old etiquette, there
were but two chairs, one for the lord of the manor
and the other for his lady; the additional seats
were mere stools.  Lilian occupied one of these
chairs, and her suitor the other.  On one of the
stone benches within the ingle sat Juden Stenton
still trimming hawks' lures; opposite was Beatrix,
spinning with all the assiduity of Arachnè.  These
from time to time regarded her with furtive
glances, which roused her anger not less than the
presence and odious attentions of their lord did her
apprehension.  She felt a load accumulating on
her breast, as the night wore on; anxiety was
impairing her strength and weakening her
fortitude, and whenever Clermistonlee addressed her,
she answered only by tears.  Touched at last by
her sorrow, a sentiment of generosity at times
would prompt him to return her to her home;
but other thoughts came with greater power, and
the momentary weakness was immediately dismissed.
</p>

<p>
"Psha!" thought he; "'tis only a woman."
</p>

<p>
Sitting close by her, he spoke from time to
time in a low voice; and the scorn, malice, and
jealousy which lighted up the keen grey eyes and
pinched features of the fallen and forgotten
Beatrix on these occasions, filled the gentle Lilian
with a horror and pity which she could not
conceal.  The presence of this unfortunate woman,
who, with the indefatigable Juden, formed now
his entire household, was a curb for the present
on the vivacity of his lordship's passion, and
seemed to restrain it within the decorous bounds
of gentle whispering.  He soon tired of that, and
ordering supper to be laid, took advantage of the
domestic's absence to draw his chair still nearer
Lilian, and take her hands within his own.  She
was so humbled, so gentle and broken in spirit,
that she permitted them to remain, and the
passiveness of the action made the heart of
Clermistonlee glow with additional ardour.
</p>

<p>
"She loves me in secret," thought he; "but
how charming is her coyness&mdash;how enchanting
her modesty!  My dear Lilian&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, oh cease to persecute me thus.
What wrong have I done you?  In what have I
offended, that you should make me so utterly
miserable?"
</p>

<p>
"What a soft, low, charming voice!  Does it
offend you, to hear the sighs of the most
honourable love that ever warmed a human heart?"
</p>

<p>
"This is the mere cant of love-making&mdash;flirtation&mdash;the
phrases you have addressed to hundreds.
My Lord, I know their full value, and despise
them.  'Tis enough!  I can have no love for
you."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"None&mdash;so for heaven sake spare me more of
this humiliation, and let me begone to the house
of Bruntisfield."
</p>

<p>
"Now what strange infatuation is this?  No
love for me?" mused the egotist.  "Why,
damsel, when I was in London with Charles, all the
women were mad about me&mdash;I was quite the rage.
Rochester and I led the way in everything.  But
that was before Bothwell Brig."  He glanced at
a veiled picture that often attracted his eye, and
disturbed the current of his thoughts.  "No love
for me," he resumed, after a pause.  "My pretty
one, does my zeal offend you?"
</p>

<p>
"Like your flattery, it does; and my captivity
here&mdash;a captivity which, I fear, will ever
be a stain upon my honour, makes me abhor
you."
</p>

<p>
"Abhor?  Oh! 'tis a word never said to me
before.  Provoking Lilian!  But," he added,
maliciously, "you are right&mdash;your honour is lost,
and there is only one way to redeem it."
</p>

<p>
She gave him a momentary glance of inquiry and
disdain.  Clermistonlee drew a ring from his
finger.  Lilian started back.
</p>

<p>
"Never&mdash;never! death were better."
</p>

<p>
"Hah&mdash;then you are still thinking of him&mdash;this
beggarly boy&mdash;this nameless soldier&mdash;this
so-named Fenton.  'Tis a cursed infatuation, Madam;
for doubtless, soldierlike he will forget you, while
the flower of your youth is wasted in fruitless
reliance on his constancy and advancement to
honour and fortune."
</p>

<p>
"Forget me?" reiterated Lilian, raising her
bright blue eyes to the speaker.  "Oh no, he never
will forget me!  Dear, dear Walter," she added,
weeping bitterly; "I know thy worth and truth
too well to lose my own."
</p>

<p>
"He will forget thee," said Clermistonlee,
angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Never!" replied Lilian, energetically clasping
her hands.  "In the busy city and on the lonely
hills, in the hour of battle and storm by sea and
land, he will ever think of me&mdash;ever, ever!"
</p>

<p>
"But he may be slain?" said the lord maliciously.
</p>

<p>
"Cruel&mdash;cruel!"
</p>

<p>
"What then&mdash;hah?"
</p>

<p>
"No second choice would ever make me violate
the solemn vow I pledged to him&mdash;that plight
which I called on heaven to witness and angels to
register."
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee made no reply, but her fervour
and her words stung him to the soul; her eyes
sparkled and her usually pale cheek glowed; but
he knew that it was for the love and by the
recollection of another; his first thoughts were those
of wrath; his second spleen and sorrow.  He
arose and stepped aside a little.
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunate that I am!" said he, with something
of sadness and real love in his tone and
manner.  "By what witchcraft am I so hateful
to her; but I must quit her presence for a time at
least, or lose all hope of her favour for ever."
</p>

<p>
He walked to and fro, while Lilian, resigned
again to tears, covered her face with her
handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"Beatrix," said Clermistonlee, in a fierce whisper
to the shrinking woman, as she laid supper on
the long dark oaken board, over which six tall
waxen candles flared from a great iron
candelabrum.  "Beatrix Gilruth&mdash;hear me, old
shrivel-skin!  Hast never a love philtre about thee?
Ere now I have known thee to my own cost use
such things."
</p>

<p>
She gave a keen and fierce glance with her
sunken eyes, and drawing him into one of the
deeply bayed windows, pointed to where the
square keep and round towers of the castle of
Corstorphine threw a long dark shadow across the
frozen lake that, like a mirror before its gates, lay
shining in the cold light of the winter moon.
</p>

<p>
"You see yonder castle?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And the aged sycamore beside the dovecot-tower?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then remember how, nine years ago, the lord
of that fair mansion perished under its shadow;
and how his own good rapier, urged by the hand
of the woman he had wronged, was driven&mdash;yea,
to the very hilt&mdash;in his false and fickle heart.
Often at mirk midnight have I seen the dead-light
glimmering on his tomb in St. John's kirk,
and illuminating the west window of the
Forresters' aisle."
</p>

<p>
She gave him a glance so expressive of hatred,
fear, contempt, and reproach that he almost
quailed beneath it; and as she pointed to the
veiled portrait, he turned abruptly away.  Her
words and allusion had evidently a deep effect on
Clermistonlee.  He was about to retire, but paused
irresolutely, turned, and paused again.  Then
kissing Lilian's hand, he said in a gentle tone&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me if I have offended, but love for
you makes me perhaps act unwisely.  Adieu, dear
Lilian: if my presence is obnoxious, I hasten to
relieve you of it.  Till to morrow, adieu; and
pleasant dreams to you."
</p>

<p>
He bowed profoundly, and retired to his own
apartment followed by Juden, who kept close to
his heels as a spaniel would have done.
</p>

<p>
"Will you not sup, Madam Lilian?" asked
Beatrix in a kinder tone than usual.
</p>

<p>
"Sup&mdash;oh, no!"
</p>

<p>
"Bethink you, lady; the whole day hath passed,
and you have tasted nothing but a posset of milk
with a little sack.  Still weeping!  'Twas so with
me once; but I shall never weep again, until I
have wrung tears of blood from my betrayer."
</p>

<p>
"Now you are going to frighten me again.  A
light, if it please you, good woman; I will retire.
Another night under his roof!  My poor aunt
Grisel.... how bad, how wicked is this!"
</p>

<p>
"My lord desired me to ask if you wished to
read a little: it may compose your mind."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!&mdash;a thousand thanks, kind Beatrix.
Bring me a Bible, if you have one."
</p>

<p>
Beatrix laughed.
</p>

<p>
"A Bible! when was one last seen in the tower
of Clermiston?  Not since the days of auld Mess
John, I warrant; and his was torn up by the
troopers for cartridges.  There is nothing here
but a rowth of evil play and jest books, and some
anent hawking, hunting, and farriery, and others,
my bairn, that suit only&mdash;women like me."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Beatrix!" said Lilian kindly, touching
her hand, for the exceeding humility of her manner
raised all her pity.  Beatrix surveyed her for a
moment, with a troubled and dubious expression.
Seldom was it that a word of compassion or
commiseration fell upon her ear.  Her heart was
touched; a moisture suffused her eyes; but, fearing
to betray her feelings through the outward aspect
of moroseness and misanthropy she had assumed,
she set a light upon the cabinet of the bedchamber,
and hurried away.
</p>

<p>
Again, as on the preceding night, Lilian fastened
the door; and though the number and complication
of its ancient iron locks somewhat reassured
her, her heart sank when she surveyed the great
gloomy tester-bed, with its dais, its solemn
plumage and festooned canopy&mdash;the sombre
wainscotting, and well-barred window, past which the
changing clouds were hurrying in scudding masses,
alternately obscuring and revealing stars.  Kneeling
at a chair near the fire, she prayed long and
fervently, and, with innocent confidence, arose
more assured and courageous, though aware that,
by anxiety, want of food and rest, her natural
strength and spirit were greatly impaired.  A folio
volume lay upon the cabinet; it was covered with
purple velvet, on which a coat of arms and these
words were exquisitely embroidered:&mdash;"Alison,
Lady Clermistonlee, on her marriage day, ye
penult Maij, 1668."
</p>

<p>
The hand of her tormentor's unhappy wife had
probably worked these words; all the dark and
mysterious stories concerning her misfortunes and
her fate came crowding upon the mind of Lilian,
and filled her with melancholy forebodings.
Perhaps, thought she, this was her chamber, and that
her bed, where often she had wept away the dreary
night in unseen and unregarded sorrow.  Full of
mournful interest, she unclasped and opened the
volume.  It was the "Bentivolio and Urania" of
Nathaniel Ingelo, one of the prosy and
metaphorical romances of the seventeenth century.
The first words arrested her, and she read on.
</p>

<p>
"He was no sooner entered within the borders
of the forlorn kingdom of Ate, than the
unhealthfulness of the air had almost choked his vital
spirits; and being removed from the gladsome sun
by a chain of hills, that lifted up their heads so
high that they intercepted the least glance of his
comfortable beams: it was dark and rueful.  He
chanced to light upon a path that led to Ate's
house, which was encompassed with the pitchy
shade of cypresse and ebon trees, so that it looked
like the region of death.  As he walked, he
perceived the hollow pavement made with the skulls
of murdered wretches.  At the further end of this
dismal walk he espied a court, whose gates stand
open day and night; in the midst whereof was
placed the image of cruelty, with a cup of poyson
in one hand, and a dagger wet with reeking
bloode in the other.  Her hairs crawled up and
down her neck, and sometimes wreathed about her
head in knots of snakes; fire all the while sparkling
from her mouth and eyes......"
</p>

<p>
This dismal passage in no way tended to alleviate
the perturbation of her spirits; and, hastily
closing the volume, she prepared to retire.  Aware
that proper repose was absolutely necessary to
enable her to sustain all she might have to
encounter or endure from Clermistonlee, remembering
the apparent security of her apartment, and
somewhat reassured by the cheerful blaze thrown
by the fire upon the dark brown panelling and
high old-fashioned bed, she slowly and reluctantly
began to undress, often pausing to re-examine her
room; but, perceiving nothing more to alarm her,
gathering up the bright tresses of her hair into a
caul, she unrobed and sprang into bed.  The sleep
and the heaviness that preyed upon her now
completely evaporated; and, more awake than ever,
she felt only the keenest sensations of fear, and
her prevailing horror was Clermistonlee.  By the
light of the wood fire, that poured its broad blaze
up the massive stone chimney, she surveyed the
room with watchful eyes, that ached from the
very intensity of their gaze, and the shadows of
the carved posts seemed like those of giants thrown
against the panelled wall.
</p>

<p>
Weariness overcame her, and she was about to
drop asleep, when a sound was heard, and one of
the doors of the cabinet rattled and opened; a cold
wind blew upon her face; and by her recumbent
position, she beheld a steep staircase winding away
down into darkness she knew not where, between
the masonry of the massive wall.  She would have
screamed, but terror chained her tongue; and
almost fainting, and afraid to move or breathe,
she continued to regard it with the most painful
anguish and intense alarm.  But up that dark and
mysterious outlet, so suddenly disclosed, no sound
came but the night wind, which moved the oak
door of the cabinet mournfully to and fro.
</p>

<p>
Lilian's strength seemed utterly to have left
her; and, though painfully anxious to learn the
secrets of this staircase, which communicated so
immediately with her bedchamber, she lacked
equally strength to rise, and presence of mind to
examine it.
</p>

<p>
But the current of air that swayed the door to
and fro, closed it; the sound rumbled away in the
far echoes of the tower, and all became still.  Now
more alarmed by the reflection that she was
sleeping in this remote room alone, with a secret
entrance, she bitterly regretted her imprudence in
undressing, but had not the courage to rise and
repair what a certain prophetic apprehension
made her fear had been very unwise.
</p>

<p>
Excessive lassitude at last completely overcame
her, and she slumbered.
</p>

CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE ATTEMPT.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Once in a lone and secret hour of night,<br />
  When every eye was closed, and the pale moon<br />
  And stars alone shone conscious of the theft,<br />
  Hot with the Tuscan grape, and high in blood,<br />
  Haply I stole unheeded to her chamber.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAIR PENITENT.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When Clermistonlee retired from the hall to
the study or parlour, which was the only comfortably
furnished apartment in the dreary old tower,
he resigned himself to reflection, and sipping his
mulled sack, a great tankard of which Juden placed
unbidden, and quite as a matter of course, at his
elbow.  His thoughts at first ran in the usual
channel,&mdash;a determination to possess Lilian, from
the double incentives of passion and pecuniary
necessity.  He was on the brink of ruin; and her
property, or expectations of it, were ample and
noble.  She was very unprotected; the land was
convulsed and trembling on the verge of a great
civil war, though as yet no tidings had reached
Edinburgh of what was passing in England; and
so, as the sack diminished in the tankard, his
lordship's thoughts became in proportion more strange,
more amorous, and confused.  His brain wandered.
He was restless and uneasy; his flowing dressing-gown
seemed to fit him like a horse-hair shirt;
and his disturbed manner was not unobserved by
his faithful and subservient factotum.
</p>

<p>
The latter attempted some consolation, after his
fashion; but it was not palatable.
</p>

<p>
"Begone to the bartizan!" exclaimed his master,
angrily, "and bring me instant tidings if
anything seems astir in the country about us.
I expect news from the city hourly.  Leave me."
</p>

<p>
Juden vanished.
</p>

<p>
"The deevil tak' lovers and lords!" he muttered,
as he drew his broad worsted bonnet over
his cross visage, and ascended to the bartizan of
the tower, and setting his teeth hard, as he faced
the keen north wind, took a survey of the dreary
and snow-covered landscape.  On the passing
wind ten o'clock came sullenly from the spire of
St. John of Corstorphine; then all was deathly
still save the sough of the winter breeze as it
swept over the dreary Lee, and whistled through
the open corbells of the projecting tower.
</p>

<p>
Juden had no particular fancy for enacting the
part of warder in so cold a night, and after taking
a rapid survey of the extensive waste, he was
about to descend again, when an unusual redness
in the sky to the eastward arrested him.  It rose
in the direction of the city, and resembled the
lurid and wavering glow of a great conflagration.
The red blaze was rapidly spreading and crimsoning
the edges of the dusky clouds above, and
throwing forward in strong relief the southern
edge of the Corstorphine Kills, and the dark pines
that shaded them.  Astonished, perplexed, and
alarmed, Juden continued to gaze in the direction
of the light, until a loud hollo startled him, and
he perceived a man on horseback close to the foot
of the tower.
</p>

<p>
"Ho!" cried Juden through his hand, for the
wind blew keen and high.  "What want ye,
friend?"
</p>

<p>
"No a night's lodging, or I wadna come here,"
answered the other testily.  "Closed gates and
dark windows betoken cauld cheer and a caulder
ingle."
</p>

<p>
"Beware o' your tongue, friend," replied the
butler from aloft.  "Langer lugs than yours hae
been nailed to the tower yett.  You have come
frae Edinburgh I warrant?"
</p>

<p>
"Troth have I, on the spur, man, so open the
yett, Juden Stenton."
</p>

<p>
"What's a' the steer there this night?"
</p>

<p>
"Gif you had been there ye wad ken,"
responded the other with sulky importance.  "I
bear a letter for my Lord Clermistonlee on the
king's service, which king Gude kens and the
Deil cares."
</p>

<p>
"Thir are kittle times, friend," replied the
butler, warily; "so if King James himsel' came
to the peel o' Clermiston this mirk night, not a
bolt would be drawn, or a lock undone.  Tie the
letter to this twine, gossip, and sae gang your way
in peace."
</p>

<p>
Rendered cautious by the nature of the times,
and by being constantly on the alert against force
and treachery, the wary old servitor lowered over
the wall a string, to which after sundry curses
the horseman tied a letter, and Juden towed it up,
"hand over hand."
</p>

<p>
"Ill folk are aye feared," said the stranger;
"and I doubt there are but few clear consciences
in Clermistonlee.  My horse is sair forfoughton
wi' my ride frae the West Port; he fell at the
Foulbrigs, and was nigh swept awa' when fording
the Leith doon by there; but I maun een ride on
to his honor the Laird o' Niddry without a stirrup
cup or a 'God save ye.'  Out upon Clermiston
and its ill-mannered loons!" and dashing spurs
into his horse, the servant galloped at a hunting
pace away to the westward, and disappeared
among the hollows at the verge of the Lee.
</p>

<p>
Anxious to learn the contents of a letter in
which he doubted not he had as much interest as
his Lord, Juden hurried down the corkscrew
stair from the bartizan, and repairing to the little
study where his half-muddled master was gazing
dreamily into the fire, and imbibing his sixth cup
of sack, he placed the little square billet before
him.  Clermistonlee tore it open, and read
hurriedly,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Dear Gossip,
</p>

<p>
"A glorious revolution hath been accomplished,
(and I am just drinking to its success in
sugared brandy,) but Satan seems to have broken
loose in the city, whilk the rascal sort hath fired
in six different places.  The acts of Estate and
Council are mere nullities.  Your presence is
required by the Council anent ane address to the
new king.  We are to have a grand onslaught
to-morrow against Baal's prophets, the Host of
Pharaoh, and a' that, ye ken.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Yrs. at service,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MERSINGTON."<br />
</p>

<p>
"<i>Postscriptum</i>.&mdash;Keep the bonnie bird in the
cage close; her kinsman Napier hath been slain
by young Fenton, and ye know how the entail
stands.  Vale!  King William the Second of
Scotland for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee's first impulse was to start up
and buckle on his sword, exclaiming,
</p>

<p>
"My gambadoes, Juden; the red leather ones&mdash;saddle
Meg, and, peril of thy life, look well to&mdash;but
no&mdash;no!  I will not.  Thou mayest go to the
devil, Mersington, with thy drunken scrawl, the
address, and the Council to boot.  I leave not
Clermiston to-night.  Napier slain&mdash;and by
Fenton!  By George, how the plot is thickening!
'Tis glorious.  Juden, don your shabble, and ride
to the city; tell my gossip Mersington in the
<i>matter</i> pending, mark me, knave! in the matter
pending to use my name as he shall deem
fitting."
</p>

<p>
Juden replied by a leer of deep cunning (for he
too was something of a politician), and, animated
by an intense curiosity to know what was acting
in the city, hurried away, and in ten minutes had
left far behind him the dreary tower and frozen
muir, above which its dark outline reared like that
of a spectre.
</p>

<p>
As the fumes of the wine mounted upward, the
heated imagination and inflamed passions of
Clermistonlee got completely the better of his senses.
Thoughts of Lilian's beauty and helplessness came
vividly before him; but such reflections instead
of kindling his pity, roused all his passion for her
to an ungovernable height.  Draining a cup of
brandy to make him yet more reckless of
consequences, and snatching a candle, he staggered
from the room, and descended the narrow stone
stair that led from his apartment.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he was alone, for Beatrix was
under lock and key; yet he stepped with singular
caution.  Every stone in the rough walls seemed
a grotesque face, regarding him with mockery and
wrath; he saw a figure in every shadow, heard a
step in every whistle of the midnight wind.  He
dared not look at portraits as he passed, lest their
eyes might seem to move; and thus, though the
entire consciousness of his dark intent came
broadly and appallingly home to his heart, such
was the influence of his ungoverned passions that
a spirit of the merest obstinacy urged him to
finish what he in part commenced, and the high
pulsations of his heart increased at every step
which brought him nearer to the chamber of his
victim.
</p>

<p>
He entered the hall.  The feeble rays of his
upheld candle seemed only to reveal the size and
darkness of the place, and the grey winter twilight
that struggled through its thickly grated and
deeply-arched windows.  The embers of the fire
still smouldered on the hearth, and, reddening
when the hollow wind rumbled down the wide
chimney, threw the shadows of the great oaken
table, the dark grotesque cabinets and highbacked
chairs in long and frightful figures on the paved floor.
</p>

<p>
Entering the almonry, he opened a door, within
it, which revealed a narrow passage in the wall
that communicated with the secret outlets of the
place, and led directly to the cabinet in Lilian's
room.
</p>

<p>
He stood within it, and the warmth of its
atmosphere increased the ferment of his blood.
Unconscious of the proximity of so dangerous a
visitor, the innocent girl slept soundly, but lightly.
</p>

<p>
Shading the light with his hand, he gazed
impatiently upon the slumbering beauty.
</p>

<p>
Her hair, which overnight she had put up with
the carelessness so natural to grief, had now
escaped from the caul, and rolled over the pillow
in masses that glittered like gold in the rays of
the uncertain light.  She was very pale, but a
slight glow began to redden her cheek, and it was
graced with a smile of inexpressible sweetness.
</p>

<p>
Twice he approached, and twice drew back
irresolute.
</p>

<p>
An unseen hand seemed to restrain him; the
air of perfect innocence pervading the presence of
the sleeping girl protected her for a time; and
scarcely daring to breathe, the intruder continued
to gaze upon her.  She slept softly.  At last,
tears fell over her cheeks, and she tenderly
murmured&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dear Walter, have I not said that I love you?"
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee, on whose bent-down cheek her
soft breath came, started at these words as if a
serpent had stung him.  One of those fierce,
malicious, and scornful smiles, which so often
imparted to his handsome features a fiendish
expression, contracted them but for a moment;
another of intense sadness and languor replaced
it.  At that instant, unable longer to restrain
himself, he clasped her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Lilian!" he exclaimed, "dear Lilian, be not
alarmed&mdash;it is I."
</p>

<p>
A piercing shriek, that startled the furthest
recesses of the old and desolate tower, burst from
the lips of Lilian; it was one of those deep and
wailing cries of pain and horror which, when once
heard, are never forgot.
</p>

<p>
"Villain, unhand me!  Oh! spare me, my
Lord&mdash;spare me for the love of God!"
</p>

<p>
"Be calm, Lilian&mdash;why should you fear me?
Do I not adore you?  Yes; I prize your love
beyond the possession of life.  Dear girl, look
not on me thus.  I am the most devoted of lovers,
and by this kiss, dearest&mdash;&mdash;d&mdash;nation!"
</p>

<p>
He attempted to kiss her; but, endued with
new strength by rage and fear, her little hands
clutched fiercely his thick mustachios, and twisted
his head aside, as she had done once before so
effectually.
</p>

<p>
"Hear me!" he continued, "hear me, sweet
Lilian; I came but to say that I loved thee&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"Love me! oh! horror!&mdash;leave me, or I shall
expire&mdash;leave me!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment a loud explosion, followed by
the fanfare of trumpets and the ruffling of
kettle-drums beneath the walls of the tower arrested all
the faculties of Clermistonlee, and by throwing
his thoughts into another channel, covered him
with shame; and he started back, the image of
astonishment and irresolution.
</p>

<p>
Not so Lilian; her presence of mind was
instantly restored.  Springing to a window, and
fearlessly dashing her hands through the panes of
glass, she cried in agonized accents&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Help! help! for the love of the blessed God!
Help me, or I perish!"
</p>

<p>
"Lilian!  Lilian!" cried a voice that filled her
with transport.  It was that of Walter Fenton.
</p>

<p>
A glance sufficed to show her a gallant troop of
horse halted beneath the tower in the grey
morning twilight.  Again she would have spoken, but
the strong hand of Clermistonlee dragged her
furiously back into the apartment.
</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TICKELL, Edit. 1749.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From the hour in which Lilian had been torn
from her, the ased Lady Grisel had never raised
her head.  Affection and horror, wrath and
insulted pride, had all aggravated to the utmost the
weakness and debility consequent to exceeding
old age; and by her weeping domestics the
venerable dame was borne to her great chair in the
Chamber-of-Dais, where she remained long
insensible to all that passed around her.
</p>

<p>
The storm and hurry of political events
employed otherwise Sir Thomas Dalyel and those
friends who might have served her in this
dilemma; and now she found herself quite
deserted.
</p>

<p>
Syme the baillie, and the whole male population
of the barony had fruitlessly searched the
Burghmuir for the remainder of the night and
morning; but, for reasons which will shortly be
apparent, any application to the Privy Council or
magistrates of Edinburgh would have been utterly
futile, as their attention was amply occupied by
more important matters than the abduction of a
girl.
</p>

<p>
Long fits of stupor, succeeded by querulous
bursts of passion, left the poor old lady so weak,
that, as Elsie related to Sir Thomas of Binns,
"between the night and morning, she cried on
Sir Archibald <i>to save</i> her doo Lilian; and then
she just soughed awa like a blink o' the sunshine,
and lay back under her canopy in the Chaumer-o'-Deese,
a comely corpse to see as ever was streekit."
</p>

<p>
The old lady did not die, however, but recovered
her senses by having a pistol fired at her
ear by the rough old Muscovite trooper, "a cure
for the vapours, whilk," he said, "he had often
seen practised on Samoieda."
</p>

<p>
As before related, in consequence of the
vigilance of Sir James Montgomerie, the Privy
Council and people of Scotland had been kept for
several weeks in a state of painful uncertainty as
to the fate of James's affairs in England: but a
letter from Lord Dundee reached the Scottish
ministry, expressive of apprehensions for the issue
of a conflict between the troops of the King and
those of his invader.
</p>

<p>
To ascertain the true aspect of affairs, they
despatched into England a man named Brand,
a baillie of Edinburgh, who basely betrayed his
trust by carrying his despatches straight to
the Prince of Orange, to whom he was introduced
by Dr. Burnet.
</p>

<p>
On Craigdarroch's arrival at the Scottish capital,
and others with similar tidings of the desertion
and dissolution of the army, the flight of James,
and success of William, the long-threatening storm
burst forth in all its fury.  Scotland at that time
swarmed with brave and hardy soldiers, skilful
officers, ruined barons, and desperate vassals&mdash;the
veterans of the Covenant, and the endless wars of
Sweden, France, and Flanders; thus, ingloriously
as the campaign had passed over in the south, a
cloud was gathering on the Highland hills, that
threatened to descend, as of yore, in wrath and
blood on the fertile Lowlands.
</p>

<p>
Infuriated by the severities of what was called
the "twenty-eight years' persecution," the Lowland
population were ripe for armed revolt, and
the capital, to which they flocked in overwhelming
masses, became the grand centre of their
operations, and the scene of newer atrocities.  The
greatest outrages were committed upon the
persons and property of those unhappy Catholics,
Episcopalians, and cavaliers, who fell into the
hands of this wild mob.
</p>

<p>
Perth, the Lord Chancellor fled; the Privy
Council, which had been severe to the nation, in
proportion as it was servile to James, dispatched
an immediate address to William, and none were
more cordial in their offers of dutiful service than
Provost Prince, and the worthy council of Edinburgh:
those very men who had so lately declared
to the unfortunate Stuart, that they "would stand
by his sacred person on all occasions."  Now
they were equally prompt in offers to his
dethroner, to whom they complained bitterly "of
the hellish attempts of Romish incendiaries, and
of the just grievances of all men relating to
conscience, liberty, and property."
</p>

<p>
For three days the capital was in the power of
a mad and lawless rabble, who, rendered furious
by bigotry and intoxication, committed the most
dreadful atrocities.
</p>

<p>
The houses of all who were obnoxious to them
were plundered and given to the flames, and all
effects of value were scattered in the streets.
There were episodes of horror ensued such as
Edinburgh had never witnessed before.  The
streets were filled with the smoke of burning
houses; the air was sheeted with flame; the
shrieks of the perishing inmates, the howls of
their destroyers, and the crash of falling masonry,
rang night and day.  The college of the Jesuits
was levelled to the dust; crosses, and reliques,
statues, pictures, and vestments were borne aloft
through the streets, and consigned to the flames
amid yells of derision.
</p>

<p>
The ale and wine found in the cellars of the
cavaliers, inflamed the inborn savagism of the
multitude, who were urged by their ministers to
commit a thousand nameless atrocities.  For three
days they continued in a state of perfect
intoxication (says Lord Balcarris in his <i>Memoirs</i>), and
in open daylight, in the crowded streets of the
city, committed upon the persons of many Catholic
ladies such outrages as cannot be written, and
"without any attempt being made by the authorities
to restrain such brutality."  (pp. 22, 27.)
</p>

<p>
Of all the members of the old government none
was more obnoxious to the people than Sir George
Mackenzie, of Rosehaugh, the celebrated lawyer
and essayist, who had rendered himself an object
of intense hatred, by the severity with which he
had stretched the criminal laws to answer the
views of the Government; and who, in his office
of Public Prosecutor, had obtained the unenviable
soubriquet of "the persecutor of God's saints,"
"the blood-thirsty advocate," "bluidy Mackenzie;"
and to this hour his vaulted mausoleum at
Edinburgh is regarded with hatred and loathing
by the old Cameronians and "true blue" Presbyterians.
</p>

<p>
His mansion in Rosehaugh Close was soon
made the object of attack.  The night of the
third day had closed over the city, and still the
scene of tumult and frenzy, the din and the flames
of destruction, loaded the air with sounds of horror
and outrage.
</p>

<p>
In great anxiety for his personal safety, the
unhappy statesman heard with no ordinary
perturbation the increasing roar of sounds, like the
chafing of a distant sea; the mingling of a myriad
human voices, and the rush of feet, which
betokened the approach of a vast mob.
</p>

<p>
With drums beating before them, and armed
with various weapons, the thousand bright points
of which gleamed in the lurid blaze of the uplifted
torches, a dense mass of ragged, squalid, and
insane-looking men, poured like a human flood
into the deep and narrow alley at the foot of
which still stands the house of Rosehaugh.
Begrimed with smoke and filth, maddened by
intoxication and excess, their yells as they
resounded between the solid walls of the narrow
street, rang like those of fiends from some deep
abyss, and the heart of Mackenzie died away
within him.  To appeal to their pity would be
like craving mercy from the waves of an angry
ocean? there was no escape, no remedy, no bribe,
no hope; for among that terrible mob were the
fathers, the sons, the brothers&mdash;yea, and the
mothers of those who at his instance had perished
in thousands, by the sword, by the torture, and
the gibbet, or were lingering out a miserable
existence as slaves and bondsmen in the distant
Indies.
</p>

<p>
"My God! my God! for what am I reserved?"
he exclaimed, as from a lofty upper window he
surveyed the dense mass of madmen, who, wedged
in the alley below, impeded each other's motions.
Conspicuous above all, raised on the shoulders of
two strong men, whose arms and faces were smeared
with blood and blackness, there was upborne a
man, whose sad-coloured garments and white
bands announced him a preacher; his gaunt
visage and long hair of raven hue waving around
a face ghastly, though flashed with passion, his
large hazel eyes glowing like those of a tiger,
his upraised hands clenching one a bible, and the
other a broadsword, declared him a wild
enthusiast (another "Habakuk Mucklewrath").
</p>

<p>
It was Ichabod Bummel, who had escaped from
the damp vaults of the wave-beaten Bass, and had
now come to take vengeance on Mackenzie for his
exile, his captivity, his crushed bones, and long
persecution.
</p>

<p>
"Come forth, Achan, thou troubler of Israel!"
he shrieked; "come forth, thou destroyer of the
good and just, thou persecutor of the saints of
God! come forth, thou thing that art accursed, or
we will burn thee in the ruins of thy dwelling,
and salt them with salt.  Courage, my brethren!
Oh, is not this a brave hour and a glorious one?
For lo, the time is come when the host of
Pharaoh shall be discomfited and stricken as of old.
Achan, thou persecutor of the covenanted kirk,
behold me towering amid Baal's prophets, four
hundred and fifty men, as the book saith!"
</p>

<p>
This rhapsody was responded to with yells of
ardour, and the din of hammers rang like thunder
against the strong oaken door of the mansion,
while many bullets were discharged at the
windows, which were securely grated.  A door of
massive oak closed the entrance of the turnpike
stair, and though the whole house resounded
under the energy of the blows, the barrier refused
to yield, though gradually it was falling in splinters,
a process too slow to suit the fierce impatience of
the increasing mob.
</p>

<p>
"Let fire be brought," cried Ichabod, "let the
mansion be consumed, that its flames may be as
a light to the house of Judah.  Know, O thou
persecutor of God's covenanted saints, that a
sword is this night upon the inhabitants of
Babylon, and upon her princes, and her mighty
men; for it is the load of graven images, and they
are mad upon their idols."
</p>

<p>
Urged by this blasphemous application of
Scripture, burning brands were heaped by the
people against the door, and soon the increased
yells of satisfaction announced to the miserable
advocate that the barrier was rapidly giving way,
and that in another moment the reeking hands of
the destroyers would be upon him.  He threw
round a glance of agony, the barred windows
denied all hope of escape, and now his stern soul
sank at the prospect of a cruel and immediate
death, when lo! one tremendous yell of another
import brought him once more to the shattered
windows.  "It is a dream!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
A troop of the Royal Life Guards, with their
bright arms flashing in the light of the waving
torches, were hewing and treading down the mob
like a field of rye; and chief above all shone one
cavalier&mdash;it was Dundee&mdash;the gallant, the terrible
Claver'se, that man-fiend, whom all deemed six
hundred miles away.  There was no mistaking
the splendour of his armour, the nobility of his
air, the ferocity of his purpose.
</p>

<p>
"Close up&mdash;fall on, gentlemen; no quarter to
the knaves!" he exclaimed, while, standing erect
in his stirrups, he showered his blows on every
side, his white plumes rising and falling in unison
with his trenchant rapier.
</p>

<p>
"Hey for King James!  Ho for the cavaliers!
Down with the rebels&mdash;down with the whigamores!"
cried Holsterlee and others, as they
pressed forward, and the rabble grovelled in the
dust beneath the tremendous rush of the heavy
horses, and their riders in steel and buff.  In a
minute the narrow alley was cleared of the living,
and piled knee-deep with dead and dying.  The
shrill voice of Ichabod, as he was borne off by his
disciples, was heard dying away in the distance,
like that of an evil spirit carried away by a stormy
wind.
</p>

<p>
By something like a miracle, Lord Dundee had
traversed the whole of hostile England, and
though menaced on every hand by great bodies of
troops, had reached his native capital in safety;
bringing with him not only the sixty cavalier
troopers (who of all his cavalry alone remained
staunch to him), but with them Walter Fenton,
Lord Dunbarton, Finland, and other officers
retaken from De Ginckel.  They now rode under
his orders as gentlemen-troopers, mounted on
heavy black chargers that had whilome belonged
to the Swart Ruyters; and the whole, with
standards displayed, had entered the city about
an hour before the assault on Rosehaugh's house.
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Dr. Joram, late chaplain to the Royal
Scots, also bestrode a horse which he had taken
as his spoil in battle; and had donned a trooper's
corslet, with which his clerical bob-periwig
consorted as oddly as with the fierce and tipsy
expression of his flushed and florid face, and with
the stern cock of the Monmouth beaver that
surmounted it.  The gallant divine had recently
imbibed so much wine that he could scarcely keep
his saddle.
</p>

<p>
Of the fate of their captured comrades they as
yet knew nothing; but Gavin of that Ilk, with
twenty other officers and five hundred men, were
then at London, close prisoners; the rest had
returned to their colours; and after a time, the
whole, seeing the futility of resistance, ultimately
embarked peaceably under the orders of their new
commander, the veteran Duke de Schomberg.
None were punished, "as the new government
had not yet been fully recognized in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
Rosehaugh had been saved from a terrible
immolation; but the services of the night were not
yet over.  Claverhouse, with his cavaliers, retired
to a quiet part of the city, under protection of the
castle batteries, where a brave garrison of Catholic
soldiers, led by the Duke of Gordon, remained
yet staunch to James.
</p>

<p>
"My lord Earl," said Dundee to Dunbarton,
"we must be somewhat economical of our persons
and horses, when encountering these mad burghers
and drunken saints, and not forget that we are
the last hope of the King in this hotbed of
Presbytery and rebellion."
</p>

<p>
"True," replied the Earl, "and I rejoice that
we have but few to regret, and few to mourn for
us if we perish in the struggle on which we are
about to plunge."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the Viscount filled with dusky
fire.
</p>

<p>
"Dunbarton," said he, "I am alone in the
world.  Our grateful King has given me honours
to which none can succeed, for I have cast the die
by which they are lost for ever; and nowhere can
my coronet be more gloriously surrendered than
on the battle-field."
</p>

<p>
"I thank Heaven that the Countess, my dear
little Lætitia, is in England," said the Earl,
pointing to the lurid flames that from the blazing
houses of the Abbey-hill flashed along the
shadowy vista of the Canongate, glowing redly under
the arch of the Nether Bow, and throwing forward
in bold relief a thousand fantastic projections of
the old Flemish mansions that reared up their
giant fronts on either hand.  "I thank Heaven
that she is in a safer place than this poor city of
wild fanatics."
</p>

<p>
"Would that I could say the same of Lilian!"
thought Walter, with a deep sigh.  "Can she be
safe amid all this dreadful uproar?"
</p>

<p>
At that moment a dense rabble approached,
with drums beating, torches blazing, and weapons
glinting.
</p>

<p>
"To the Palace! to the Abbey!" cried a
thousand hoarse voices.  "Let us pull doon the
temple of the Idolater, and gie his fause gods to
the flames!" and they swept forward, greeting
the troop of Guards with yells of hatred and
menace.
</p>

<p>
They were led&mdash;by whom?  Lord Mersington,
with his wig awry, his clothes soiled with dust,
and his face flushed with exertion!  The Earl of
Balcarris relates "that this fanatical judge, with
a halbert in his hand, and drunk as ale and brandy
could make him," led on the rabble to the assault
of time-hallowed Holyrood; but before reaching
the eastern extremity of the city, his followers
were joined by the trained bands in their buff
coats and bandoleers, the magistrates, and other
authorities, who vested this lawless mob with an
air of order and official importance.
</p>

<p>
"Will those villains really dare to molest the
palace of our kings?" said Dundee, his eyes
kindling, as he looked after the revolters, and
reined-up his impatient horse.
</p>

<p>
"What will they not dare?" rejoined Dunbarton;
"but I doubt not they will experience a
warm reception.  Wallace, who commands the
guard, is a brave cavalier as ever drew sword, and
the traitors will make nothing of it."
</p>

<p>
"Under favour, my Lords," said Fenton,
"they are in great numbers, and I have
misgivings as to the issue."
</p>

<p>
"Wallace&mdash;he is an old friend of mine," said
Finland.  "'Sdeath! we've seen some sharp
work together on the frontiers of Flanders; and
with your permission, my Lords, I will take a
turn of service with him to-night."
</p>

<p>
"As you please," replied the Viscount;
"Dunbarton commands here, though he rides in my
troop.  Go&mdash;ha, ha! two heads are better than
one."
</p>

<p>
"I go then; and yonder fanatical senator may
beware how he comes within reach of my hand."
</p>

<p>
"Thy riding-whip, say rather."
</p>

<p>
"I volunteer also," said Walter, who was under
great anxiety to have an opportunity of visiting
Lilian.
</p>

<p>
"And I too," added the Reverend Jonadab
Joram.  "I long to encounter with bible and
bilbo, yonder preacher of sedition, that urges on
this unhanged rout of traitors.  For know ye,
gentlemen, (hiccup) that one preacher is better in
Scotland than twenty drummers to find recruits
for the devil's service; so, in his own phraseology,
I will gird up my loins, and go forth to battle
against them.  Come on, gallants!  Ho, for King
James, and down with the whigamores!  Rub-a-dub,
rub-a-dub&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Beware, sirs, for the good cause has not many
such spirits to spare," said Claver'se, as they
dashed spurs into their horses, and making a
detour down one narrow wynd and up another,
reached without interruption the deep groined
archway of the Palace Porch, an ancient gothic
edifice, heavily turreted and battlemented.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
SACK OF HOLYROOD.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  'Twas a dream of the ages of darkness and blood,<br />
  When the ministers' home was the mountain and wood;<br />
  The musquets were flashing, the blue swords were gleaming,<br />
  The helmets were cleft, and the red blood was streaming;<br />
  The heavens grew dark, and the thunder was rolling,<br />
  When on Welwood's dark muirland the mighty were falling.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANONYMOUS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Welcome, gentlemen," exclaimed Wallace;
"I never stood in such need of advice and
comradeship."
</p>

<p>
He was a handsome man, above six feet in
height; his gold-coloured cuirass and buff coat,
laced with silver, announced him a captain; the
slouch of his broad Spanish hat, with its drooping
plumes, and the tie of his voluminous white silk
scarf, gave him inimitable grace.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, Finland, to share the poor cheer
and hard fighting of Holyrood.  By Mahoun! but
times are changed with the King's soldiers.  I have
endured a three days' siege here, and matters are
not likely to mend."
</p>

<p>
"No; a rabble, many thousands strong, by all
the devils! the very riddlings of St. Ninian's and
the Beggars' Row, are at this moment approaching,
and if one of your guard are left alive by daylight
it will be a miracle."
</p>

<p>
"Dost think so?" rejoined Wallace, as he led
them to a table in the outer court of the palace,
where a lantern placed on a table revealed a few
drinking horns, a keg of eau de vie, and some
objects of a more unpleasant nature, the dead
bodies of several soldiers, shot by the rioters
during the day.  "You hold out a dark future to
us, Finland, and, nevertheless, like the true
soldier I have ever known thee, come to take a turn
of service with us."
</p>

<p>
"As you see," replied Finland, laughing, as he
filled a horn from the keg unbidden.
</p>

<p>
"Drink with me, gentlemen," said Wallace.
</p>

<p>
"With all my soul!" hiccupped Dr. Joram.
</p>

<p>
"This keg of brandy was lately in the cellars of
the Jesuits, and some friendly rogue trundled it
our way.  God bless the good old cause! my
service to ye, sirs.  Hark, comrades&mdash;drums!" he
added, as he drained and threw down the cup.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the march of the trained bands," said
Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" rejoined Wallace, sternly.  "Let
all the whigamore scum of Scotland come, they
are welcome.  I am one of the good old race of
Elderslie, and I thank heaven that in an hour like
this, it hath been the hap of one of my name to
have entrusted to his care the defence of the
palace of our princes, and yonder holy fane, the
sepulchre of their bones&mdash;one of the fairest piles
that ancient piety ever founded, or modern
fanaticism destroyed."  His swart countenance lighted
up, and signing the cross (for this noble cavalier
was a true catholic), he drew his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Hark, a chamade!" said Walter Fenton;
"now let us hear what these rascals have the
impudence to say;" and the three cavaliers repaired
to the porch, leaving the divine to continue his
devoirs to the brandy keg.  They beheld a very
extraordinary scene.
</p>

<p>
Wallace's company was an Independent one.
It was something less than a hundred strong, and
had the great porch of the palace and the two
lesser gates of the boundary wall to defend.  In
the former there were sixty musqueteers drawn
up, as it was the point of the greatest danger; the
remainder were posted at the small gates, which
were well secured by internal barricades.  The
great façade of the magnificent palace, with its
deep quadrangle and six round towers, loomed
through the starless gloom of the winter night;
lights flickered in the gallery of the Kings of
Scotland, and through the lofty casements of its
long corridors and echoing chambers, for there
many proscribed catholic and cavalier families,
terrified women, and helpless children, hud fled
for refuge.  And from the great western windows
of the chapel royal shone "the dim religious light"
of the distant altar, where many a devout
worshipper, in the ancient faith of our fathers, sent
up, with catholic fervour, the most solemn prayers
to God for conquest and for succour.
</p>

<p>
How different was the scene without those
sacred walls, with their shadowy aisles, their
glimmering shrines and marble tombs&mdash;their dark,
deep, solemn arches, and mysterious echoes.
</p>

<p>
Through the strong gate of vertical iron bars
that closed the dark round archway of the porch,
the cavaliers beheld the long vista of the
Canon-gate, extending to the westward.  Its long
perspective of ancient and picturesque edifices,
turrets, outshots, and gables, was vividly lit up by
the crimson glare of the blazing houses on the
Abbey-hill, to the northward of the palace.
</p>

<p>
A dense mob that had gathered in the Cow-gate,
provided with weapons and torches, mingled with
Trained Bandsmen, and having drums beating, and
the Earl of Perth's effigy, borne aloft before them,
after traversing the West Bow and High-street,
maltreating all they met, were now descending
the Canon-gate; and the light of their brandished
flambeaux streamed through the groined portal of
the palace, glittering on the helmets and arms of
the soldiers drawn up within it in close array,
and beyond on the tall outline of the tower of
James V.
</p>

<p>
As the drums of the Trained Bands continued to
beat the point of war, the rabble poured forth
from all the diverging wynds and alleys, until,
like a river swollen by a hundred tributary streams,
the dense mass that debouched upon the open
space around the ancient Girth-cross of the once
holy sanctuary, covered the whole arena.  The
united roar of ten thousand angry voices swelled
along the lofty street, and the red torchlight
revealed many an uncouth visage, distorted by
drunkenness, fanaticism, and ferocity.  Several
musquets and pistols were incessantly discharged,
while stones, sticks, fragments of furniture, dead
cats, and every available and imaginable missile
were hurled in showers over the battlements of
the porch, and strewed the pavement of the court
within.
</p>

<p>
In front were Grahame and Macgill, two captains
in the trained band, armed with their buff
coats, steel caps, and half pikes; several baillies,
in their scarlet gowns and gold chains; Lord
Mersington, reeling about and brandishing a
partisan, his senatorial wig and robes in a woeful
plight; the Rev. Ichabod Bummel, bare-headed
and spurring like a madman a short, plump, and
active Galloway cob of which he had possessed
himself, and over the flanks of which, his long
spindle shanks and scabbard trailed upon the
ground.  On each side were the Marchmont and
Islay heralds, the Unicorn and Ormond pursuivants,
in their tabards blazing with embroidery,
and their tall plumed bonnets; behind was a
confused forest of uplifted hands, and weapons,
swords, pikes, staves, and halberts which flashed
incessantly in the wavering glare of the brandished
torches, and chief above all were the effigy of the
Chancellor, and a great orange and blue standard;
the first the colour of the Revolutionists, the
second of the Covenanters.
</p>

<p>
The houses of the Earl of Perth, the Lairds of
Niddry, Blairdrummond, and others, were blazing
close by, and the sky was sheeted with fire.  The
contents of their cellars were rolled into the streets
and staved, and the rich and luscious wines of
France, the nut-brown ale, and crystal usquebaugh
streamed along the swollen gutters, where
hundreds of rioters were wallowing like pigs in the
kennel, and were trod to death beneath the feet of
the mighty host that swept over them.  After a
flourish of trumpets, the senior herald cried with a
loud voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In the name of the Lords of His Majesty's
Privy Council, I, the Islay Herald-at-Arms,
summon, warn, and charge you, Captain William
Wallace, under pain and penalty of loss of life and
escheat of goods&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yea, and the loss of salvation," screamed
Ichabod, with a voice of a Stentor, as he
brandished his bible and bloody sword.  "Woe unto
ye who march against God with banners displayed!
Woe unto ye who would build up the walls of
Jericho, which the Lord hath casten down!  Take
heed, ye vipers and soldiers of Jeroboam, lest the
curse that fell on Kiel, the Bethelite, fall upon ye
also!  Woe unto ye, worshippers of the Babylonian
harlot, the mother of sin, for the hour is
come when it is written that ye shall perish!"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;&mdash;And escheat of goods and gear," continued
the herald, "forfeiture of name and fame."
</p>

<p>
"Surrender, ye d&mdash;d loons!" cried Mersington,
"or hee hee, we'll gie ye cauld kail through the
reek, conform to the Acts of Estate."
</p>

<p>
"Sound trumpets for silence!" exclaimed the
herald indignantly; but now the voice of
Mr. Bummel was again heard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh for one moment of the hand that smote
the foes of Zion!" he exclaimed, raising to heaven
his sunken eyes that in the torchlight seemed
to fill with a yellow glare.  "Oh for God's
malediction on the brats of Babel!  Lo!  I see a sign
in the lift&mdash;they are delivered unto us, that we
may dash them against the stones.  On, on, and
spare not! smite and slay! death to the false
prophets! death to the soldiers of the idolatrous
James!"
</p>

<p>
"I, the Islay Herald-at-Arms&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Haud your d&mdash;d yammering!" cried Captain
Graham, of the trained bands, interrupting in
turn; "close up, my trained men! come on, my
buirdly Baxters, and couthie craftsmen&mdash;advance
pikes&mdash;musqueteers, blow matches&mdash;give fire!"
</p>

<p>
"Give fire!" re-echoed the deep voice of Wallace
within the groined portal.  A loud discharge
of musquetry took place, and the bullets of the
mob rattled like a hailstorm against the walls, or
whistled through the archway of the porch.
</p>

<p>
Three soldiers fell dead, but nearly forty of the
rabble were shot, for every bullet fired by the
"Brats of Babel" killed at second hand.  Still
they pressed forward with undiminished courage,
and assailed the three gates of the palace at once,
and pressing close to the bars of the portal, fired
their musquets and pistols through with deadly
precision on the little band within.  Here Wallace
commanded in person, with a bravery worthy of
his immortal name, and encouraged by his animated
exhortations, his gallant few, though falling
fast on every hand, stood firm, with a resolution
to die, but never surrender.
</p>

<p>
Walter Fenton and Finland commanded each
about twenty musqueteers at the lesser gates,
which the insurrectionists assailed pell-mell with
hammers and pickaxes, and as nothing but a cruel
death could be expected if this mob of infuriated
madmen obtained entrance, the poor soldiers
fought as much for their lives as for honour and
protection of the palace and chapel royal.  From
a platform of planks and furniture, overlooking
the south back of the Canon-gate, Walter's party
poured a fire upon the mob with deadly effect;
the palace wall was high, the gate strong and well
secured, so they hurled ponderous stones and
swung hammers against its solid front in vain.
</p>

<p>
So it fared with Finland, who defended the
northern doorway of the royal gardens near a
little turretted edifice called Queen Mary's Bath.
This experienced soldier had speedily made four
loop-holes through the strong wall, and the rioters,
as they approached the gate, were shot down in
such rapid succession that an appalling pile of dead
and dying lay before it, forming a barrier so
hideous, that their companions began to recoil in
dismay, and poured a storm of bullets and abuse
from a distance.
</p>

<p>
The blaze from the Abbey hill illuminated the
whole garden, and the dark buttresses, the square
tower, the deep-ribbed doorway, and tall lancet
windows of the beautiful church of the Sancta
Crucis were all bathed in a blood-red hue by the
flaring sheets of flame that ascended from the
burning houses.
</p>

<p>
"St. Bride speed you, my gallant Douglas!"
cried Wallace, who, anxious for the maintenance
of his post, made a hurried round of the walls.
"Art keeping the knaves in check?"
</p>

<p>
"Let the deed show," replied Finland.  "By
my faith! their dead are lying chin deep without
the barrier.  'Twas a brave stroke in tactics this
enfilade of the approach; and the flames of yonder
great mansion enable my bold hearts to aim with
notable precision."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the noble lodging of the Great Chancellor,"
rejoined Wallace, turning his flushed face
towards the ruddy glow; "and I grieve deeply
that many noble dames of the first quality are
likely perishing amid yonder flames; however,
death is preferable to dishonour at the hands of
fanatical clowns.  This day they dragged my sister
through the streets ..... and in open day&mdash;my
God!"  He ground his teeth and smote his
breast.
</p>

<p>
"Malediction!" exclaimed Finland; "can we
not succour them?"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible," replied the other, resuming his
military nonchalance.  "I cannot spare a man.
Bonnie blackeyed Maud, of Madertie, and Merry
Annie, of Maxwelton, are both yonder; this
morning they fled to the house of Perth.  God sain
them both&mdash;now I must see how fares young
Fenton."  He hurried away, leaving Finland
transfixed by what he had revealed.
</p>

<p>
"Follow me, some of ye," he exclaimed; "let
six maintain the post.  Come on, gallants&mdash;we will
save these noble dames or die."
</p>

<p>
His party had now been reduced to twelve, but
forgetful of everything save the probable danger of
Annie, he rushed through the garden followed by
six soldiers armed with pikes, and leaving the
precincts of the palace by a secret doorway near
the old royal vault, hurried through the narrow
suburb of Croft-an-Righ, and felt his heart leap
as the hot glow of the burning houses was blown
upon his cheek, and the sparks fell like red hail
around him.  The roar of voices and of musquetry
still continued around the palace with unabated
vigour; but here the mob lay generally wallowing
in the liquor that flowed along the street, or were
busy in revelling around piles of wine flasks,
runlets of wine, and barrels of ale, or hurrying
away with whatever plunder they had saved from
the fast-spreading conflagration.
</p>

<p>
The house of the chancellor, a lofty edifice,
with turrets at the angles, steep roofs, and great
stacks of chimneys, stood a little way back from
the street, with a row of tall Dutch poplars before
it; but these were now blackened and scorched
by the forky flames that rolled in volumes from
the windows, and clambered over the sinking
roofs.  The smoke ascended into the clear air in
one vast shadowy pillar, and showers of sparks
were thrown as from the crater of a volcano.
Not one of the inmates was visible, for every
window was full of flame, and Finland felt
distraction in his mind as he gazed upon the blazing
house; but suddenly several females appeared
upon the stone gutters and upper bartizan,
waving their handkerchiefs and crying in piteous
accents for mercy and for succour; but they were
unheeded by the mob, or, if heard, only treated
with derision.
</p>

<p>
"A ladder, a ladder!" exclaimed Finland, whose
arms and attire were so much disfigured by smoke
and dust, that he seemed in no way different from
the other armed citizens that thronged the streets.
"Death and confusion! a hundred bonnet pieces
for a ladder; my brave friends, my good comrades,
your pikes&mdash;truss them into a ladder.  Ere now
I've led an escalade of such a turnpike.  Bravo,
my bold hearts!" and with the silent precision of
practised campaigners, the soldiers with their
scarfs trussed or tied their six pikes into the
form of a scaling ladder.  In a moment it was
placed against the wall.  "Guard the passage,"
cried Finland, as he disappeared through one of
the upper windows.
</p>

<p>
The heat and smoke were so great that he could
scarcely breathe; for the old mansion being all
wainscotted, burned like a ship, and ancient
paintings, costly hangings, carpets, furniture, books,
and all the magnificent household of the great
chancellor was crumbling to ashes beneath the
relentless flame.
</p>

<p>
The hot conflagration often drove Finland back,
and made his very brains whirl; but he found
other passages, across the yielding floors, and
ascending from story to story, at last felt gratefully
the cooler air upon his flushed and scorched face
as he stepped upon the flame-lighted bartizan, and
Annie, with a wild hysterical laugh, threw herself
into his arms and immediately swooned.
</p>

<p>
"Your hand, Lady Madertie&mdash;away, away!"
cried he; "we have not a moment to lose;"
and bearing his burden like a child, he attempted
to descend the staircase; but lo! the forked flames
shot up the spiral descent and drove him back
upon the platform, which was thirty feet in height.
</p>

<p>
All retreat was cut off.
</p>

<p>
Annie was insensible, and Finland, as he leant
against the parapet and pressed her to his breast
and felt the masses of her soft hair blown against
his face, became giddy with despair.  At a little
distance Matilda of Madertie, a beautiful blonde,
was kneeling before her crucifix, and praying
with all the happy fervour of a true Catholic; her
long dark hair was streaming over her shoulders.
Near her were several female servants, crouching
against the parapet, and who, exhausted by the
energy of their shrieks, and the near approach of
death, lay in a kind of stupor, without motion,
and seeming scarcely to breathe.  Finland thought
only of Annie; but a glance sufficed to show that
their fate was sealed.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the lofty house beneath the turret
where they stood was an abyss of flames, and
the glare, as they flashed upward and around him,
compelled him to close his eyes; and thus a
prey to grief and horror, he moved to and fro
upon the toppling wall until the slate roofs sank
crashing into the flaming pit with a roar, and now
one vast sheet of broad red fire ascended into the
air, making the calcined walls that confined it rend
and tremble; a shout came up from the street
below; the whole city, the hills and the sky seemed
to be on fire.  The flames came closer to Finland;
he felt their scorching heat; the next seemed
to sweep his cheek, and Annie's waving locks and
his own, that mingled with them, were burned
away together.
</p>

<p>
"Laird of Finland," cried a soldier from below,
"the tree&mdash;-the tree!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis death at all events," replied the Cavalier,
and quick as light, with his long scarf, he bound
the slender waist of Annie to his own, and stretching
from the wall, got into the lofty and strong
poplar tree, and began to descend slowly and
laboriously.  A shout burst from the soldiers in
the garden below.
</p>

<p>
"God receive us!" cried Maud of Madertie,
holding up her crucifix to heaven.  At that
moment the wall gave way beneath her, and she
disappeared for ever.....
</p>

<p>
Finland's desertion of his post proved ultimately
fatal to the defence of Holyrood, which by the
efforts of Wallace, Walter Fenton, and the
church-militant, Dr. Joram, was protracted until eleven
at night.  Then the soldiers of Finland, having
been all shot down, a party of the Trained Bands,
led by Captain Grahame, broke down the gate
with sledge-hammers, and then the armed mob,
roused to an indescribable pitch of frenzy and
ferocity by the liquors they had imbibed, the
resistance and slaughter, and the exhortations of
the religious maniacs who led them, crowded like
a hell disgorged into the outer court and inner
quadrangle of the palace.
</p>

<p>
Taken thus in flank, the soldiers of Wallace
were almost immediately destroyed.  That brave
cavalier was hewn down, his body was hacked to
pieces, his entrails torn out and cast into the air.
Many of his soldiers who surrendered were shot
in cold blood, and all the wounded perished.
Walter Fenton, gathering a few of the survivors
upon his platform, still continued to fire upon the
sea of madmen that swarmed around them.
</p>

<p>
Conspicuous among his followers, upon his
prancing Galloway cob, towered the tall and
ghastly figure of Mr. Ichabod Bummel; and,
urging the work of death, he sent his powerful
voice before him wherever he went.
</p>

<p>
"No quarter to the birds of Belial!&mdash;smite them
both hip and thigh.  On, ye chosen of Israel, who
now, in the good fight of faith, shall extirpate the
heathen, sent forth even as the Jews were of old."
</p>

<p>
"Pick me down yonder villain!" cried Fenton
to his soldiers; and bullet after bullet whistled past
the head of the preacher, but he seemed to bear a
charmed life, and escaped them all.
</p>

<p>
"On, on to the good work, and prosper!" he
cried.  "Smite and slay! smite and slay! lest the
curses that befel Saul for sparing the Amalekites
fall upon ye."
</p>

<p>
Thus urged, the people hewed the soldiers limb
from limb, and the bodies of the dead shared the
same fate.  Seeing all lost, Walter and Dr. Joram
had torn the cavalier plumes from their hats, and
leaped upon their horses, hoping to cut their way
through the press, or escape unknown.  But, alas!
Joram was recognised by the terrible Ichabod, who,
urging his Galloway towards him, brandished his
sword, and exclaimed with stentorian lungs&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a priest of Baal, and this night will I send
him howling to his false gods!  Come on, Jonadab
Joram, thou wolf in sheep's clothing."
</p>

<p>
"Approach, thou d&mdash;ned, round-headed, prick-eared,
covenanting, and rebellious rapscallion!"
cried the Doctor in great wrath, urging his horse
towards his clerical antagonist; but the crowd was
great between them, and they were enabled to glare
at and menace and bespatter each other with
scriptural abuse and very hard names for some time
before they came within sword's point; for they
were both intoxicated, the one with brandy, and
the other with an enthusiasm that bordered on
insanity.  "Come on, thou villanous whigamore,"
cried Joram, flourishing his long rapier; "thy
glory and thee shall depart to the devil together!"
</p>

<p>
"Out upon thee, and the bloody papistical
Duke whom thou servest, and hast blasphemously
prayed for; but the curse that fell upon Jeroboam
hath already fallen upon him&mdash;he shall die without
a son, and be the last of his persecuting race,
despite the brat in the warming pan."
</p>

<p>
"On thy carcase, foul kite, will I avenge this
treason against the Lord's anointed!" replied
Joram, spurring his horse.
</p>

<p>
"Thou fool!" shrieked Ichabod, with a hollow
laugh; "was that accursed tyrant who fiddled
while Rome blazed beneath him the anointed of
the Lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Have at thee, trumpeter of treason!"
</p>

<p>
"Caitiff and firebrand of hell, at last I have
thee!" and their swords flashed as they fell upon
each other like two mad bulls.  The superior
strength and skill of the cavalier chaplain quite
failed him before the ferocious enthusiasm of the
Presbyterian, whose long broadsword, swayed by
both hands, was twice driven through his body at
the first onset.
</p>

<p>
"King and High Kirk for ever!" cried poor
Joram, as he fell forward with the blood gushing
from his mouth; but, still unsatisfied, Ichabod
seized him as he sank down, writhing one hand in
his hair, and throwing the body across his saddle-bow,
he slashed off the head, and held it aloft, a
grinning and dripping trophy.
</p>

<p>
"Behold," he exclaimed in an unearthly voice,
"behold the head of Holofernes!"
</p>

<p>
All was over now.  Walter gave a hurried glance
around him.  The palace was being sacked by the
rabble, who carried off all they could lay their
hands upon; but it was upon the beautiful chapel,
that venerable monument of ancient art and David's
pious zeal, that the whole tide of popular fury was
poured.  In five minutes it was completely devastated.
The tall windows, with their rich tracery
and stained glass, were destroyed; the magnificent
tombs of marble and brass, the grand organ, the
altar with its burning candles and great silver
crucifix, the rich oak stalls of the Thistle, with the
swords, helmets, and banners of the twelve
knights,&mdash;were all torn down, and the beautifully
variegated pavement was stripped from the floor.
</p>

<p>
All the wood and ornamental work, the pictures,
reliques, furniture, vestments, &amp;c., were piled in
front of the palace, and committed to the flames
amid the yells of the populace, whose cries seemed
to rend the very welkin.  Dashing spurs into his
horse, Walter gave him the reins, and sweeping
his sword around him, right, left, front and rear,
he broke through the crowd, and, followed by a
score of bullets, galloped up the Canongate and
escaped,&mdash;the sole survivor of that night's slaughter
at Holyrood.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE VEILED PICTURE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  To the Lords of Convention 'twas Claver's that spoke,<br />
  Ere the King's crown shall fall there are crowns to be broke;<br />
  So let each Cavalier who loves honour and me,<br />
  Come follow the bonnet of bonnie Dundee.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOTT.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Skirting the city, Walter soon left the roar of
the angry multitude far behind him; he was
galloping among fallow fields, hedge-rows, and
solitary lanes, and the silence of the country was a
relief to his excited spirit after the fierce tumult
of the last six hours.  The snow had melted;
Dairy-burn, and other little rills that traversed
the dark fields, gleamed like silver threads in the
starlight.
</p>

<p>
Walter passed the loch, and reached the old
Place of Drumdryan; the house was ruined and
desolate, roofless and windowless, and the roadway
was strewn with fragments of furniture.  His
anxiety increased, and, goring his horse onward,
he dashed up the dark dewy avenue of Bruntisfield,
and reined up at the Barbican-gate.  The perfect
silence, unbroken even by the barking of a dog,
and the strong odour of burned wood, had in some
sort prepared him for the sight he witnessed.
There, too, had been the hand of the destroyer,
and a great part of the once noble mansion was a
bare, blackened, and open ruin.  Its corbie-stoned
gables and round turrets stood bleakly in bold
relief against the starry sky; and from the depths
of its vaulted chambers, the remains of the
smouldering conflagration sent forth at times a column
of smoke into the calm winter atmosphere.  The
court and garden were strewn with broken furniture,
torn hangings, books, and household utensils.
</p>

<p>
The sudden snorting of his horse drew Walter's
attention to two corpses that lay near the outer
door.  They were those of John Leekie the
gardener, and Drouthy the aged butler, who, like
true vassals, had both "with harness on their
backs" perished at their lady's threshold.  Both
had on corslets and steel caps, and one yet grasped
a broken partisan.
</p>

<p>
Full of dire thoughts of vengeance, Walter
galloped back to the city, every corner of which was
now overflown with the tide of confusion and
uproar that had been so long concentrated around
Holyrood.  He naturally sought the Castle-hill,
where Dundee and Dunbarton, with their sixty
followers, who of all the Lowlands seemed now
alone to remain true to their fugitive king, were
drawn up under the cannon of the Half-moon.
</p>

<p>
"So the villains have sacked Holyrood," said
Dundee, smiling grimly.
</p>

<p>
"To their contentment," replied Walter.  "Poor
Finland, our jolly chaplain, Wallace, and a
hundred brave soldiers, have gone to render a last
account of their faithful service; and I alone
survive, my lords."
</p>

<p>
"To avenge them, add, sir.  'Tis the hope of
repaying with most usurious interest this heavy
account of blood that alone makes me bear up,"
replied Dundee with enthusiasm; "and God give
me inspiration, for I feel I am the last hope of the
old house of Stuart."
</p>

<p>
At that time certain persons who styled themselves
a Convention of the Estates were assembled
in conclave, and thither went the brave Dundee,
though conscious that, personally or politically, he
was the bitterest foe of every man present.
</p>

<p>
"My lords and gentlemen," said he, observing
the chill that fell on the assemblage when he
appeared&mdash;-"I have come here as a peer of the realm,
to serve his Majesty James VII. and the Parliament
of Scotland; and I demand that, if the latter
has no occasion for my service, it will at least
protect my friends and self from the insults of the
base-born rabble."
</p>

<p>
With one voice this hastily collected and
illegally constituted assembly exclaimed&mdash;"We
cannot and will not!"
</p>

<p>
"Then farewell, sirs," replied the Viscount,
with a smile of pride and scorn.  "When again
I appear before you, it will not be to entreat, but
to command&mdash;it will not be to plead, but to
punish; and now, let my trumpets sound To horse!
In the country of the clans, the hills are as steep,
the woods are as pathless, the glens as deep, and
the rivers as rapid, as in the days of the Romans;
and again from the wild north shall the whole tide
of Celtic war roll on the traitor Lowlands, as in
the days of the great Montrose.  When again you
hear the voice of Dundee, my Lords of
Convention,&mdash;<i>tremble</i>!"
</p>

<p>
He clasped on his headpiece and retired.  As
the jangle of his sword and spurs descending the
stone turnpike died away, a deep silence pervaded
the dusky hall; for the threats of this chivalric
soldier, when united to their foreknowledge of his
dauntless courage, his unflinching loyalty, his
loftiness of mind, and intense ferocity, threw a
chill upon the more cold-blooded and calculating
revolutionists.  But soon the gallant blare of the
trumpet, the stirring brattle of the brass kettle-drums,
the clang of iron hoofs, and jingle of steel
scabbards and chain bridles, awaking all the echoes
of the great cathedral, and the hollow arcades of
the dark Parliament Square, announced the march
of the Life Guards&mdash;those sixty brave gentlemen
who, of all his once numerous and fondly cherished
army, now alone remained staunch to the hapless
James.
</p>

<p>
Dark looks were exchanged, and as the music
grew faint, all seemed to breathe more freely.
Then the querulous voice of Lord Mersington was
heard, and in the half-lighted hall, his dwarfish
figure, clad in his senatorial robes, was dimly seen
on the rostrum, and, as he addressed the convention,
from the effect of his recent potations and
over exertion, he swayed on his heels like a statue
on a pivot.  His speech was somewhat to the
following purpose.
</p>

<p>
"That for sae mickle as the vile and bloody
papistical James, Duke of Albany and York,
having assumed the regal sceptre without the
oath required for due maintenance of religion,
and having altered the ancient constitution of the
kingdom by ane exertion of tyrannous and arbitrary
power, had forfeited all richt to the crown
of Scotland, now and for ever; that it be forthwith
settled on the Statholder William, and Mary his
spouse; that there be made a list of grievances
to be redressed, and a new act framit, anent
witchcraft, papacy, prelacy, and ither
abominations."
</p>

<p>
The last echoes of the trumpets of Dundee had
died away under the arch of the Netherbow Port,
and the motions of Mersington were carried with
universal approbation.  "Thus," says the author
of <i>Caledonia</i> "the revolution in England was
conducted constitutionally by the parliament; but in
Scotland, unconstitutionally by the convention.
The English <i>found</i> a vacancy of the throne, the
Scots <i>made</i> one; the one grave and regarding law,
the other vehement and disregarding it."
</p>

<p>
With a heaviness of heart, a deep and morbid
sadness against which he struggled in vain, Walter
rode down the steep Leith Wynd.  He was now
a private trooper under Dundee, and leaving
Lilian far behind him; for he was going, he
foresaw, to perish under the fallen banner of a
desperate cause and ruined king; but soon the clash
of the cymbals, the fanfare of the trumpets, the
tramp of the stately horses, the high bearing of
their gallant riders, and that innate loftiness of
soul, which made Dunbarton and Dundee rise
superior to their fortune, and seem to set fate at
defiance, communicated a new ardour to his heart,
and it soon beat responsive to the martial music,
as the troop of cavaliers traversed the city's
northern ridge, and riding by the Long Gate saw
the morning sun rising afar off above the snow
clad Lammermuir, gilding Preston Bay, the far
hills of Fife, and the shining waters of the dark
blue Forth.
</p>

<p>
Dundee rode near Fenton, who, finding more
than once, the dark and pensive eyes of this
singularly handsome soldier fixed upon him with
something of that foredoomed expression, indicative
of his future fate and fame, he ventured to
ask, "Whither go you, my lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Wherever the shade of Montrose shall direct
me," was the thoughtful and poetical reply.
"Believe me, Mr. Fenton," he continued, after a
pause, "under whatever circumstances, or however
oppressed by fate, I will acquit myself before
God, the world, and my own conscience.  Yes!"
he exclaimed, with flashing eyes, and striking his
gloved hand upon his corsletted breast, "I will
hazard life and limb, estate and title, name and
fame, yes, I would peril even my salvation, were
it possible, in the cause of my honour and
allegiance; and if I cannot save the throne of King
James, at least I will not survive its fall&mdash;so the
will of God be done!"
</p>

<p>
There was something sublime in his aspect as
he spoke; his dark and lustrous eyes were full of
fire; his face, the manly beauty of which few
have equalled and none surpassed, was suffused
with a warm glow, and the proud curl of his
mustachioed lip, showed the high spirit of
achievement that burned within him.  The soul of the
great Montrose seemed indeed to inspire him,
and in such a moment all the darker and weaker
points were forgotten.  His ardour was communicated
to Walter, whose heart beat fast as he
exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
"Noble Dundee, to victory or the grave, to
the field or the scaffold, I will follow thee, and in
that hour when I fail in my duty or allegiance,
may woe betide me and dishonour blot my name!"
</p>

<p>
Dundee pressed his hand and replied,
</p>

<p>
"In the wilds of the pathless north, ten thousand
claymores will flash from their scabbards at
the call of Dundee.  The loyal and gallant clans
have not forgotten the glories of Alford,
Inverlochy, and Auldearn, when the standard of James
Grahame, of Montrose, was never unfurled but to
victory.  Again, like him, will I lead them against
this Dutch usurper, whom in an evil hour I saved
from death upon the battle-field of Seneff.  Yes,
after he had fallen beneath the hoofs of Vaudemont's
Reitres, I saved his life at the risk of my
own, and horsed him on my own good charger,
when, could his future ingratitude to me, and the
usurpation of this hour have been foreseen, my
petronel had blown his brains to the wind."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! what wants his grace of Gordon?" said
Dunbarton as the flash of a cannon broke from
the dark castle wall, and a puff of white smoke
curled away on the clear morning air, while the
echoes of the report reverberated like thunder
among the black basaltic cliffs of the great fortress
past which they were riding.  A little arched
postern to the westward opened, and a soldier
appeared waving a white flag from the brow of
the steep rock, which the turretted bastion
overhung.  The troop halted, and their kettle-drums
gave three ruffles in honour of the duke.
</p>

<p>
"Tarry for me, gentlemen comrades," said
Claverhouse, "while I confer with 'the cock of
the north,'" and galloping to the base of the
castle rock, he dismounted, and notwithstanding
his steel harness, buff coat, and jack boots,
clambered with great agility to the postern, where
he held a conference with the Duke of Gordon.
</p>

<p>
What passed was never known; but each is
said to have needlessly exhorted the other to
loyalty and truth.
</p>

<p>
The multitude, who from a distance had watched
the departure of the hated Dundee, fled back to
the city, and reported to the Lords of the
Convention, that "there was a coalition and general
insurrection of the adherents of the bluidy
Claver'se," and thereupon a dreadful panic ensued.
The city drums beat the point of war;
the Duke of Hamilton and other revolutionists,
who had for weeks past been secretly bringing
great bands of their vassals into Edinburgh, where
they were concealed in cellars and garrets, now
rushed to arms, and the members of Convention,
confined in their hall, were terrified and put to
their wit's end by the uproar.  Lord Mersington,
it is related, exchanging his senatorial robe and
wig, "for ane auld wife's mutch and plaid," fled
to his lodging, and appeared no more that day;
but their fears were causeless, for Dundee, and
the devoted cavaliers who accompanied him in his
chivalric but hopeless enterprise, were then
passing the woods and morasses of Corstorphine, on
their route to the land of the Gael.
</p>

<p>
At a hand gallop they soon flanked the grey
rocks and pine covered summits of those beautiful
hills, and the sequestered village lay before
them, with the morning smoke curling from its
moss-roofed cottages, its broad lake swollen by
the melting snows, but calm as a mirror, save
where the swan and dusky waterouzel squattered
its shining surface; the ancient kirk peeped above
a grove of venerable sycamores, and to the south
stood the castle of the old hereditary Foresters
of Corstorphine.
</p>

<p>
"What castles are these on the right and left?"
asked Dundee.  "I warrant Mr. Holster can tell;
he knows everything and everybody."
</p>

<p>
"Yonder hold with the loch flowing almost to
its gates, is the house of the Lord Forester,"
replied the cavalier trooper, "a leal man and
true."
</p>

<p>
"And that tall peel on the muirland to the
north?"
</p>

<p>
"The tower of Clermiston, my lord."
</p>

<p>
"What! the house of Randal Clermont&mdash;um&mdash;a
converted covenanter, and worshipper of the
rising sun, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis said his name is at the address sent by
the turncoat council to the Statholder," said
Dunbarton.
</p>

<p>
"Assure me of that," exclaimed Dundee,
sharply reining up his horse, "and by all the
devils, I will hang him from his own bartizan, lord
and baron though he be!  Halt, gentlemen, we
will pay these lords a visit; they, or their stewards,
must pay us riding money, for the king's service.
My lord, Earl, and thirty of you gentlemen, will
detour across to Clermiston, while I will ride
down to make my devoir to the Forester of these
hills&mdash;forward, trot."
</p>

<p>
The troop separated, and Walter somewhat
unwillingly accompanied Lord Dunbarton, whose
party galloped in single files along the muddy and
rough bridle-road that led over the lea to the gate
of the solitary tower.  They encircled the barbican
wall, which was built partly on fragments of low
rock, without being able to find entrance, the
great gate being securely fastened, and the stillness
of the place seemed to imply that it was
uninhabited.  A shriek, echoing through the vaulted
recesses of the tower, rang out upon the clear
morning air; a window was dashed open, and a
female hand, white and bleeding, appeared, while
a voice calling for aid made the blood of Walter
Fenton rush back upon his heart.
</p>

<p>
"On, on, good sirs!" he exclaimed, leaping
from his horse; "some work of hell is being
enacted here!" and he rushed against the tower
gate, making fruitless efforts to burst it open; but
they were as those of a child against the solid
planks of the barrier.
</p>

<p>
"By Mahoud's horns, Clermistonlee is at his
old tricks again!" cried Jack Holster, leaping
from his saddle, and unslinging his carbine.  "He
hath a lass in his meshes; alight gallants all, or
the fair fortress will be won by storm, while we
dally in the trenches."
</p>

<p>
"Would to God I had a petard!" exclaimed
Walter; "this gate is like a wall."
</p>

<p>
"Unsling your carbines, gentlemen," said the
Earl of Dunbarton.  "A volley at the lock&mdash;give
fire!"
</p>

<p>
Thirty carbines poured their concentrated volley
upon the gate; it was torn to fragments, and an
aperture formed which admitted the troopers; to
creep through, and rush on with his drawn rapier,
were to Walter a moment's work.  By pulling
the leathern latch of a long oak pin which secured
the door of the tower, they procured ingress, and
rushed up the turnpike stair to the hall, at the
very moment that Lilian was just sinking
backwards, with her hands clasped in despair, while
Lord Clermistonlee, enraged by her outcries, and
the new and pressing danger, was endeavouring
with ferocious violence to drag her into some
place of concealment.
</p>

<p>
"False villain!" exclaimed Walter, springing
upon him with his rapier.  "I have a thousand
insults to avenge; but this, and this, and this,
repay them all!" and he made three furious
lunges at his rival, who escaped two by the
intervention of Dunbarton, who vigorously interposed;
but he received one severe wound in the left
shoulder.  Infuriated by the sight of his own
blood, and being a man of great strength and
agility, he grappled fiercely with Walter,
breathlessly exclaiming, in accents of rage&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Woe betide thee, thou unhanged rascal!  A
sword! a sword! lend me a sword, some one!
Juden!  Traitors, I am a Lord of Parliament,
and dare ye slaughter me under the rooftree of
my own fortified house?  This is hership and
hamesucken with a vengeance!  Death and
confusion, villains; recollect I am unarmed!"
</p>

<p>
"Lend him a sword, some of you," said Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, no; spare him," moaned Lilian, who
was supported by the Earl of Dunbarton.
</p>

<p>
"Base-born runnion, and son of a dunghill!"
exclaimed Clermistonlee, with that intense
ferocity and scorn which he could so easily assume at
all times; "an hour will come when this insult
shall be fearfully repaid&mdash;&mdash;" here the clenched
hand of Walter struck him down.  Staggering
backward, making a futile attempt to recover
himself, his clutching hands tore away the veil
that concealed the portrait already mentioned.
The face it revealed instantly arrested the forward
stride and menacing sword of Walter Fenton,
who stood irresolute, trembled, and the sinking
sword half fell from his relaxed hand, as he
muttered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What is this coming over my spirit now?
That face seems like a vision from the grave to
me!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the Lady Alison, my Lord's late wife,"
said the shrill but sullen voice of Beatrix.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" rejoined Walter; "then my weakness
is over.  Give him a sword, gentlemen.  In
fair stand-up fight, I will meet him here, with
case of pistols, sword, and dagger, or anything he
pleases."
</p>

<p>
"O part them, for the sake of mercy!" implored
Lilian.
</p>

<p>
Juden came in at that moment, clad in his steel
bonnet and buff jack, and swaying an enormous
partisan, was rushing upon Walter Fenton like a
wild boar, when Holsterlee laid him flat with his
clubbed carbine.  The swooning of Lord
Clermistonlee closed the brawl for the time; loss of
blood, over-drinking, and over-excitement, had
quite prostrated all his energies.  Walter
immediately sheathed his sword, and, kneeling down,
was the first to tender assistance; for "compassion
ever marks the brave."
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee was borne away to his own
apartment by the growling Juden, whose thick
pate was little the worse of Holsterlee's stroke;
and Lilian was now Walter's next and
immediate care.
</p>

<p>
The disorder and scantiness of her attire, the
pallor and horror of her aspect, and her presence
in such a place, had previously informed him of
all, and no sooner were they in a more retired
apartment, than, throwing herself into his arms,
she wept bitterly.  Meanwhile, the unscrupulous
cavaliers were ranging over the entire household,
breaking open every press, cabinet, and girnel,
with the butts and balls of their carbines, in
search of wine, vivres, or anything else that suited
their fancies.  Juden kept always a full larder,
and its contents furnished a sumptuous breakfast.
Several whole cheeses, a cask of ale, and a
thirty-gallon runlet or two of canary, were trundled into
the hall; and a hearty repast, with the usual
military accompaniments of mirth and laughter, was
enjoyed by the hungry troopers, whose appetites
a night spent in their saddles, and a ride in the
keen air of a winter morning, had sufficiently
whetted.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes, Lilian, with faltering accents,
had informed Walter of her abduction, of the
hours of suffering she had endured, and her anxiety
to return to Lady Grisel; but, alas! poor Lilian
knew not that perhaps her only relative had
perished in the conflagration of her old ancestral
home.
</p>

<p>
Aware that Dundee meant to halt for an hour
or so, to await despatches from the Earl of
Balcarris and the ex-Lord-Advocate, Walter resolved
without delay to accompany Lilian to Edinburgh,
and there convey her to some place of safety, ere
he cast himself upon the world for ever; for from
that hour he was like a reed tossed upon the
waves of misfortune.  By the assistance of Jack
Holster, he had Clermistonlee's favourite mare
prepared for Lilian; and, after refreshing her
with a milk-posset made by the cynical Beatrix,
they departed for the city at a quick trot: the
plain buff coat, steel cap, and accoutrements of
Walter, enabling him to pass for a Royalist or
Revolutionist, as occasion required.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they began to converse, the pace of
their horses was checked, and they proceeded
slowly: forgetful of Claverhouse and of his pledged
word, Walter remembered only the presence of
Lilian; and their minds were so much absorbed
in their mutual explanations and plans for the
future, that they marked not the tardiness of their
progression towards Edinburgh.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
LOVE AND PRINCIPLE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  My promised husband and my dearest friend;<br />
  Since heaven appoints this favoured race to reign,<br />
  And blood has drenched the Scottish fields in vain,<br />
  May I be wretched and thy flight partake?<br />
  Or wilt not thou for thy loved Chloe's sake,<br />
  Tired out at length submit to fate's decree.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TICKELL.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"And this is the fate to which you have
dedicated yourself?" said Lilian, weeping; "to
become a follower of that fierce Dundee in the
desperate course on which he is about to fling
himself.  Oh, Walter Fenton, this is the very
folly of enthusiasm.  Too surely can we see that
the hand of Fate is against the House of Stuart."
</p>

<p>
"Lilian," replied her lover, with mournful
surprise, "the daughter of an old Cavalier house
should have other thoughts than these.  Remember,
dear Lilian, there is not in Europe a royal
race for which so many of the good and the
gallant, the brave and the loyal, have from the
foughten field and the reeking scaffold given up
their souls to God.  Let no man judge harshly of
those whose splendour is dimmed for a time; for
the hour <i>shall</i> come when in the full zenith of
their pride and power, the old line of our
Scottish kings&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all a dream, Walter.  The entire nations
are against them.  I feel a presentiment that they
and their followers are doomed to wither and
perish like brands in the burning."
</p>

<p>
"My faith! art turning preacher, lassie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what a prospect for thee, Walter!"
</p>

<p>
"The world is all before me; and I can always
preserve my honour, my heart, and my sword.
But thou, Lilian&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Am beside thee, dear Walter," said she, with
touching artlessness; "and is not happiness
better than honour?"
</p>

<p>
"True, true," replied the young man, while he
kissed her hand, and his eyes filled with tenderness.
"Ah, Lilian, it is the thought that I am
leaving you, perhaps for ever, that alone unnerves
me for the deadly venture in which we are about
to engage.  Hopeless though the cause of James
may be, we have sworn not to survive it; and,
come weal or woe, we will unfurl his standard on
the northern hills, and if it waves not over us in
victory, it shall never do so in defeat or dishonour;
for to the last man we will perish on the sod
beneath it.  Your memory alone will make me
sad&mdash;but am I singular?  How many of these
my brave companions have gentle ones to leave,
mothers who bless, and sisters who love them,
while I am alone.  Save thee, there is nothing
that binds me to this world.  What of it is mine?
The six feet that shall make my grave!"
</p>

<p>
"O! most ungrateful Walter," said Lilian, in a
low voice of confusion and tenderness; "is not
all that I have yours, manor and lands? are not
these possessions ample?  Greedy Gled," she added,
smiling; "what better tocher would you have?"
</p>

<p>
"Lilian," sighed Walter, in a thick voice, as he
pressed her hand to his heart, "it may not be,
dearest&mdash;yet awhile, at least."
</p>

<p>
The blushing girl gave him a timid and startled
glance of inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"I am solemnly pledged to Dundee."
</p>

<p>
"Cruel Claverhouse! has he more charms for
you than I have?"
</p>

<p>
"You know that my heart is full of you, Lilian;
but there is also room for ambition in it.  I
cannot live ignobly and obscure; as such I would be
unworthy to possess you.  I would feel myself a
nameless intruder under the rooftree of your
crested ancestors, whose armorial blazons on every
panel and window-pane, would shame my meaner
birth, and put me to the blush."
</p>

<p>
"Ungrateful! after all I have urged and said.
'Tis a dream, Walter, a mere dream, but one that
will make the world dark&mdash;oh! very dark to me."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very true; I am choosing the path of
proscription, danger, and death; but the fortune
of war may better the prospects of my faction."
</p>

<p>
"After years of separation, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"With happiness in prospect, they would soon
pass, dear Lilian."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this wicked Claverhouse! he hath quite
cast a glamour over you.  How can you talk so
calmly of years of separation?  What may not be
lost in that time?"
</p>

<p>
"My life on the field, or scaffold, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Your life is mine, Walter; it was pledged to
me.  Have you forgot the 20th of September, and
the hour by the fountain?"
</p>

<p>
"Dearest girl, how could I ever forget it?  'Tis
true, Lilian, that we are in the very flower of our
days; the bloom of our youth and existence is at
its full; love, tenderness, beauty, and
susceptibility, all glow within our hearts."
</p>

<p>
"And will not the roll of years make them dull,
diminish their force, and cool their fervour?  Oh,
heavens!  I am quite making love to you," said
Lilian, blushing crimson; "but danger and the
risk of losing you have endued me with great
boldness."
</p>

<p>
"But time will never diminish the love I bear
thee, Lilian; and the memory of this hour's bitter
struggle&mdash;this conflict between a love that is
irresistible and the strong ties of honour, that bind
me to the banner of Dundee, will haunt me to my
grave!"  Tears started into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
A silence ensued.  Poor Lilian had nothing
more to urge; and despite of all her gentleness,
felt both intensely grieved and mortified, if not
quite piqued, at Walter, whose heart was wrung
by an agony too acute for words.  As they rode
past the thick woodlands that shelter the venerable
church of St. Cuthbert, they heard a shrill but
cracked voice chanting slowly&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I like ane owl in désart am, &amp;c."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"By Jove! 'tis the villain who slew poor
Joram," exclaimed Walter, drawing a pistol from
his holsters; but the voices of two other persons
finishing the verse, arrested him.  "Astonishment! 'tis
the voice of Finland!" said Walter, as
he spurred his horse close to a fauld dyke, on the
other side of which he saw, what?  Annie Laurie,
and his old friend and brother Cavalier, Finland,
on their knees, beside Mr. Ichabod Bummel,
chanting a psalm in most dolorous accents.
</p>

<p>
"By all the devils!" said Walter, almost bursting
with laughter; "'tis the age of miracles this!
What, ho!  Dick Douglas and Mistress Anne
Laurie, singing hymns among the heather like
two true laverocks of the persecuted kirk."
</p>

<p>
"Woe unto thee, thou troubler of the just in
spirit!" cried Mr. Ichabod, unsheathing his
broadsword.  "I have plucked the youth and the
maiden like brands from the fire which is fated to
consume all such unrepentant persecutors of Israel
as thee."
</p>

<p>
"I have seen a new light," said Finland, giving
Walter a sly wink of deep meaning.
</p>

<p>
"And so have <i>I</i>," added Mistress Laurie,
demurely; "and command thee, Walter Fenton,
thou man of sin, to treat this holy expounder of
the Gospel with becoming reverence."
</p>

<p>
"Annie&mdash;oh, Annie!" cried Lilian, as she
boldly leaped the mare over the fauld dyke, and
threw herself into the arms of her friend.
</p>

<p>
"My service to you, Mr. Ichabod," said Walter,
bowing to the rawboned preacher; but quite
unable to unriddle the mystery of this rencounter,
he whispered to Finland (while the slayer of
Joram was engaged with Lilian), "What the devil
does all this mean, Dick?"
</p>

<p>
"Learn in a few words," replied Finland, who
was in as miserable a plight as dust, smoke, and a
hundred bruises could make him.  "Annie and I
had a most miraculous escape amid the horrors of
last night.  I will tell you of it anon&mdash;'twas quite a
devil of a business.  As for me, I am well used to
such camisadoes, having been blown up at Namur,
and twice nearly drowned in the Zuiderzluys; but
how my adorable Annie escaped, Heaven, who
saved her, can only know.  We were in the hands
of the most villanous mob the world ever saw;
they were about to hang me from the arm of the
Girth-cross; and Annie&mdash;oh! my blood bubbles
like boiling water when I think of what they
intended for her; when this leathern-jawed apostle,
who, with all his psalm-singing and whiggery, hath
some good points of honesty about him, brought
us off, sword in hand; we bundled out of the city
without blast of trumpet; and here we are.  As a
gentleman of cavalier principles," said Finland,
colouring, "you may marvel that I would
condescend to chant a psalm like a mere clown or
canting herdsman; but as we are utterly at the
mercy of this Ichabod Mummel or Bummel, I
had no choice.  He needs must&mdash;&mdash;tush! you
know the musty old saw."
</p>

<p>
"It is enough, maiden," said the preacher,
replying to something Lilian had said, and taking,
with an air of real kindness, the little hand of the
shrinking girl within his own great bony paw, "I
know thee to be the kinswoman of that godly
matron, Grisel Napier, who, though wedded to as
cruel a persecutor as ever bestrode a war-horse&mdash;yea,
and though leavened in their wickedness
withal, sheltered me in the days of my exceeding
tribulation, when there was a flaming sword over
Israel, and when, as a humble instrument in the
cause of that great Saviour of the Kirk (whose
coming I foretold in my <i>Bombshell</i>, whilk hath
not yet the luck to be printed), I came from
Holland to this land of anarchy, and had no where to
lay my head.  She clothed and sheltered me, for
the sake of that loved kinsman who is now no
more, slain by some accursed persecutor, whom I
would smite&mdash;yea, maiden, both hip and thigh, if
I had him within reach of this good old whinger,
that so oft hath avenged the fall of our martyrs!"
</p>

<p>
Walter instinctively grasped his sword, startled
by the stern energy of the preacher, who continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is enough maiden,&mdash;with me ye are safe,
and to a place of peace I will conduct you and your
friend; but for these two sons of the scarlet
woman&mdash;these slaves of Jezebel, who have been
nursled in the blood of our saints and martyrs,
and in whom it grieves me to think ye have
garnered up your hearts, I may not, and cannot, with
a safe conscience, protect them.  Let them depart
from me in peace; let them follow him who, ere
long, will be called to a severe account for all his
dark misdeeds&mdash;John Grahame of Claverhouse."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis sound advice, Mr. Bummel," said Walter,
tightening his reins, and drawing off his glove.
"By Heaven!  I had quite forgotten; he will have
crossed the Forth by this time, and it will require
some exertion of horseflesh to rescue my honour.
Finland, we must go.  Mount Lilian's horse.
Lilian," he added, in a low and tremulous voice,
"farewell now; commend me to Lady Grisel, and
bid her bless me; farewell, Lilian&mdash;we must part
at last;" and stooping from his horse, he gently
pressed her to his steel-cased breast, and kissed
her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Walter, remain&mdash;remain," murmured Lilian.
</p>

<p>
"It cannot be&mdash;it is impossible now; I am
pledged to Grahame of Claverhouse."  And afraid
to trust himself longer within hearing of her soft
entreaties, lest love might overcome the stern
principles of loyalty in which he had schooled
himself, he leaped his horse over the fauld dyke;
and while he felt as if his very heart was torn by
the agony of that separation, he dashed along the
road to the west, leaving Finland to follow as he
chose.
</p>

<p>
With a mind overcharged by sad and bitter
thoughts, Walter galloped madly on, retracing
the way he had come with Lilian; his mind
seemed a very whirlpool, and the events of the
last twenty-four hours a dream.  A steep old
bridge, which the roadway crossed near the ancient
manor of Sauchtoun was ringing beneath his
horse's heels, when a distant shout made him
rein up.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo!" cried Finland, as he came after him
breathlessly on the panting mare; "what the
devil&mdash;art gone mad, Walter?  Oh this
tormenting love&mdash;ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
"I envy this happy flow of spirits, Finland!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you envy me the possession of all that
fate hath left me in this bad world.  This devilish
commotion hath confiscated my free barony of
Finland, and torn my arms at the cross; still I
am more gay than thee who hath nothing to lose."
</p>

<p>
"And after parting with one you love," continued
Walter, almost piqued by his friend's lightness
of heart; "parting perhaps for ever&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tush, man&mdash;I am used to such partings.  I
have had many a love that was true while it
lasted; but none like the passion I bear my dear
Annie.  My first flame was a blue-eyed damoisella
of the Low Countries (her mother was a fleuriste
in Ghent).  I thought I loved her very much;
but somehow at Bruges, Mons, and Bergen-op-Zoom,
'twas ever the same; I always left some
one with a heavy heart; and cursed the générale,
when in the cold foggy mornings it rang through
the dark muddy streets, waking the storks on the
high roofs above, and the drowsy boors in their
beds below.  I know that the wheels of fate and
fortune are ever turning; some points may, and
others must come round, to their first starting
place, so I always live in hope.  I was very sad in
Ghent when our drums beat along the street of
St. Michael, and I bade adieu to my fair one, coming
away I remember by the window instead of the
door."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;why?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, man," laughed Douglas; "but
so we often left our billets in French Flanders.
But I assure thee, lad, that under all this gaiety
my heart is as heavy as thine; for I vow to thee,
that the recollection of Annie with her beseeching
blue eyes, her dark clustering hair and pallid
cheek, the touching cadence of her voice, and the
words she said to me are imprinted on my heart
as if the hand of Heaven had written them there.
By the bye I have composed a famous song about her."
</p>

<p>
"A song!"
</p>

<p>
"Music and all.  I wrote it on the night we
were about to sack the old house of Bruntisfield
in search of yonder spindle-shanked apostle.  Ah,
if in my absence Craigdarroch should dare&mdash;but
ho! yonder are some of our friends halted under a
tree upon that grassy knowe."
</p>

<p>
"There is something odd being acted there.
Does not yonder white feather wave in the steel
bonnet of Dundee?"
</p>

<p>
"He is permitting some false Whig to sing his
last psalm under <i>the</i> convenient branch where he
is doomed to feed the corbies.  Dundee is very
kind in that way sometimes."
</p>

<p>
Recrossing the stream called the Leith, they
rode towards a knoll that rose amid the marshy
ground near the castle loch of Corstorphine.
There a dozen of the cavalier troopers were
dismounted, and leaning on their swords or carbines,
were holding their bridles in a cluster round
Dundee, who was still on horseback, and in the
act of addressing a disarmed prisoner, in whom
with surprise and sorrow they recognized the
young Laird of Holsterlee.
</p>

<p>
Cool and collected, with folded arms he firmly
encountered the large dark eyes of Dundee, which
were fixed with stern scrutiny upon him.  The
group of his comrades surveyed him with glances
of mingled scorn and pity.
</p>

<p>
"Holsterlee!" said the Viscount, who held in
one hand a long Scots pistol, in the other a letter;
"how little could I once have suspected that you,
the best cavalier of the king's life guard, and one
in whose loyalty and high spirit I trusted so
much, would stoop to this dishonour!  The attempt
simply of deserting to take service with this vile
usurper, though bad enough in itself, is as nothing
compared to the treachery which this stray letter
has revealed.  Fool and villain! thou knowest
that I am the last hope of the king's cause in
Scotland, and that if I fall it will be buried in my
grave; and yet thou art in league with this
accursed Convention to destroy me!  A thousand
English guineas for my head, thou villanous
scape-the-gallows and companion of grooms and
horseboys, who hast squandered away a fair repute
and noble patrimony among rakehelly gamesters
and women of pleasure, dost thou value the head
of a Scottish peer at a sum so trifling? hah!"  He
uttered a bitter laugh.  "What," he resumed,
"hast thou to urge, that I should not hang thee
from the branch of this beech tree?"
</p>

<p>
"That I am a gentleman," replied Holsterlee
boldly; "a lesser baron of blood and coat-armour
by twelve descents, and should not die the death
of a peasant churl or faulty hound."
</p>

<p>
"Right!" exclaimed Dundee, whose dark and
terrible eyes began to fill with their dusky fire.
"A gentleman should die by the hand of another,
for every punishment is disgraceful.  DEATH is
the only relief from the consciousness of crime.
Thou shalt have the honour of perishing by the
hand of the first cavalier in Scotland.  <i>Thus</i> shalt
thou die&mdash;now God receive thy soul!" and pointing
upward with his bridle hand, he levelled the
pistol and fired.  The ball passed through the
brain of Holsterlee, and flattened against the
plastered wail of a neighbouring cottage.  The
body sank prostrate on the turf, quivered for a
moment, and then lay still and stiffening, with
upturned eyes and relaxed jaws.
</p>

<p>
This act, which was the most terrible episode
in the life of the stern Dundee, threw a chill on
the hearts of his comrades; but he did not permit
them to remain gazing on the lifeless remains
of one who had ridden so long in their ranks, and
who was the gayest fellow that ever cracked a
jest, shuffled a card, or handed a coquette through
the stately cotillion or joyous couranto.
</p>

<p>
"Our nags are somewhat breathed after the
hot chase he gave us, gentlemen," said Dundee,
deliberately reloading his pistol, and endeavouring
under an aspect of external composure to
conceal the immediate sorrow, remorse, and anger
that too surely preyed upon his heart.  "To
horse! sling carbines&mdash;forward&mdash;trot!" and away
they rode in silence leaving the cold remains of
the dead man lying on the grassy sward, with his
blood-dabbled locks waving in the morning wind,
while the gleds and ravens wheeled and croaked
around him with impatience.
</p>

<p>
But he felt not the one, and heard not the other.
</p>

<p>
He was stripped by the cottagers, and as his
dress was remarkably rich, to prevent further
inquiry they interred him where he lay between
the bare beech tree and the old cottage wall*.

CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE PASS OF KILLYCRANKIE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Heard ye not! heard ye not! how that whirlwind the Gael,<br />
  Through Lochaber swept down from Lochness to Locheil&mdash;<br />
  And the Campbells to meet them in battle array,<br />
  Came on like the billow, and broke like its spray!<br />
  Long, long shall our war-song exult in that day!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN LOM, OF KEPPOCH.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The <i>Revolution</i> might be said to be now fully
achieved; save Dundee, Balcarris, and a few of
their followers, all had submitted to the new
sovereign whom these two nobles would rather
have slain than acknowledged.  Dundee had been
required by a trumpet to return to the
Convention; he treated the summons with scorn, and
after cutting his way through a party sent to
intercept him, reached the Highlands a proscribed
fugitive, branded as an outlaw and traitor, and
stigmatized with every epithet that Presbyterian
rancour, heightened by the remembrance of his
former military excesses, could heap upon him.
</p>

<p>
Colin, Earl of Balcarris, the High Treasurer,
was captured and thrown into a dungeon.  The
weak and servile Melville, the crafty and fanatical
Stair (the Scottish Tallyrand), and the not less
crafty Duke of Hamilton, were now at the head
of the Government, and these, though all staunch
Presbyterians were by the king united in council
with a few of the high church nobles, an
intermixture which inflamed the animosities of both
parties, and sowed the seeds of hatred, discord,
and confusion.
</p>

<p>
With his troop of faithful cavaliers Dundee
continued to wander from place to place in the
Highlands until the beginning of May, 1689,
when he appeared at the head of about two
thousand clansmen led by Sir Donald Macdonald,
the chiefs of Glengarry, Maclean, Locheil, and
Clanronald&mdash;all names which shall ever be
associated with the purest ideas of chivalry,
generosity, and valour.  He had only about 120
horse, but they were composed entirely of
gentlemen, and were commanded by a Sir William
Wallace, a brave cavalier; Walter Fenton was his
cornet, and carried the standard.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant-General Hugh Mackay, of Scoury,
now commander-in-chief of the Scottish forces,
Colonel-Commandant of the Scottish Brigade, and
Privy Councillor of Scotland, marched against
him at the head of nearly five thousand foot, and
with two regiments of cavalry.  Neither the fall
of Edinburgh Castle (which Sir John Lanier
demolished), nor the disappointment of assistance
from Ireland which James had promised him,
could damp the ardour of the brave Dundee.
Deficiency of provisions had compelled him to
shift his quarters frequently, and his devoted
followers had endured the most severe privations;
but under these they disdained to complain, when
they knew that Dundee shared them all.  Like
Montrose, he was eminently calculated for a
Highland leader.  In his buff coat and headpiece
he marched on foot, now by the side of one clan,
and anon by the ranks of another, addressing the
soldiers in their native Gaelic, flattering their long
genealogies, and animating the fierce rivalry of
clanship by reciting the deeds of their forefathers,
and the sonorous verses of their ancient bards.
</p>

<p>
"It has ever been my maxim, Mr. Fenton,"
said he to our friend on one occasion, "that no
general should command an irregular army in the
field without becoming acquainted with every man
under his baton."
</p>

<p>
On the 17th June, 1689, he marched to the
Pass of Killycrankie, where one of the most decisive
battles in Scottish history was bravely fought and
fruitlessly won.  Dawn was brightening on the
hills of Athole; and Walter, who, quite exhausted
by a long series of hardships, cold, starvation, and
a pistol-shot wound, was sleeping under his horse's
legs, was aroused by the sonorous and guttural cry
of a sentinel, who screamed out in Gaelic&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hoigh, Mhic Alastair Mhor!  Hark to the
war-drum of the Saxon!"
</p>

<p>
It was the morning of a battle!  Walter's first
thought was of Lilian; his second of the prospects
of victory.  The dear image of Lilian made him
rise superior to his fortune.  Since they had so
abruptly separated, he had never heard from her;
and it was now many months.  How long the
time seemed!  Amid his dreamy musings, the
gentle expression of her face often came powerfully
to his recollection, with, all the vigour of a
deeply impressed vision; and recollection
summoned the tones of her sweet voice to his heart
like the memory of some old familiar air, and all
the gushing tenderness of his soul was awakened.
But with these remembrances too often came
bitterness and despair, and he kissed with all a lover's
fervour the scarf her hands had wrought him.
Gleams of memory, and vivid visions of happiness,
which he foresaw too surely could never be
realized, made his heart swell alternately with tender
recollections and joyous anticipations, that died
away to leave him hopeless and despairing.  Now
they were on the brink of a battle which Walter
welcomed with anxious joy, for it would be not less
decisive as to the issue of his love, than for the
fortune of James and the fate of the British
people.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious morning in June; the purple
summer heather, the long yellow broom, the wild
briar and honeysuckle, that clambered among the
basaltic cliffs, loaded the air with a rich perfume;
while, through the savage and stupendous gorge
of Killycrankie, the rising sun poured a flood of
golden lustre, bringing forward in strong light the
wooded acclivities of those sublime hills, that
heave up to heaven their scaured and wooded sides,
involving in dark shadow the deep rocky chasms,
through which the foaming Garry rushes to mingle
its waters with the rapid Tummel&mdash;chasms so
profound, and hidden by the overhanging foliage, that
the roar only of the unseen water was heard,
awakening the echoes of the dewy woods and
shining rocks.
</p>

<p>
Nothing in nature can surpass the wild grandeur
and imposing sublimity of this mountain gorge,
the frowning terrors of which, in after years, so
impressed a brigade of Hessians in the last of our
Scottish wars, that they refused to penetrate what
appeared to them to be the end of the habitable
world.  Save the mountain torrent foaming down
from the lofty hills, appearing one moment to
hurl its spray against the shining rocks, and urge
masses of earth and stones along with it, and
disappearing the next, as it plunged into the bosky
woodlands,&mdash;all was still as death in that Highland
solitude, when, in steadiness and order, Dundee
drew up his little host at its northern verge,
admirably posted on well-chosen ground, two miles
from the mouth of the pass; the only road to his
position being the ancient pathway that wound
along the face of the precipitous cliffs, where the
least false step threatened instant destruction even
to the most wary passenger.
</p>

<p>
Dundee's band&mdash;for it was indeed no more,
though named an army&mdash;was only two thousand
strong, and composed of various little parties,
which were the nucleus of the corps he expected
yet to form.  On the right was the soi-disant
regiment of Sir John Macdonald; a small body of
the clans, under the illustrious chiefs of Locheil,
Glengarry, and Clanronald, the Atholemen under
Ballechin, Wallace's troop of horse, and a corps
of three hundred half-clad and miserably accoutred
Irishmen, composed the mainbody.  Dundee's old
troop, in which rode the Earl of Dunbarton, his
officers, and several Highland gentlemen, formed
the reserve of cavalry.  The Highlanders, arrayed
each in the picturesque tartan of their native tribes,
were formed in close ranks, with their filleadhbegs
belted about them; their brass-studded targets,
long claymores, ponderous poleaxes, and long-barrelled
Spanish rifles, shining in the rays of the
meridian sun.
</p>

<p>
The brandishing of weapons and clan-standards,
and the fierce notes of war and defiance, as the
various pibrochs rang among the echoing hills,
announced that the troops of Mackay were in sight.
And now the brave and anxious Dundee, clad in
his rich scarlet uniform, with the tall plumes
waving on his polished headpiece, his fine features
full of animation, and his black eyes alternately
clouded by anxiety, or flashing with valour and
energy,&mdash;galloped from clan to clan, inspiring them
by every exertion of graceful gesture and military
eloquence to add that day to the fame of their
forefathers.
</p>

<p>
The murmuring hum which, from afar off,
announced the drums of Mackay, grew more and
more palpable, and increased until the hoarse and
sharp reverberations of the martial music rang
between the steep impending rocks of the long
mountain pass through which the foe was
penetrating.  Anon the Scottish standards, the red
lion with the silver cross, and one with that of
St. George (borne by Hastings' regiment), and the
yellow banners of the Scots brigade, appeared at
intervals of time, and weapons were seen flashing
through the openings of the chasmed rocks and
sable woods of drooping pine.
</p>

<p>
The day had passed slowly in anxious expectation:
it was evening now, and the sun had verged
to the northwest, but from between gathered
masses of saffron clouds streams of dazzling light
were radiating; and the setting rays, as they
poured aslant on the mountain sides, made the
deep pass seem darker as it receded beyond them.
The rattle of the drums, and the blare of trumpet
and bugle, the clank of bandoliers and tread of
feet, rang with a thousand reverberations between
the brows of that tremendous gorge, as the army
of Mackay debouched from its windings, and
formed successive battalions on the little level
plain or hollow, above which the fierce and
impatient Highlanders, "like greyhounds in the slips
straining upon the start," were formed in array of
battle.  Undauntedly they surveyed the measured
steadiness and precision of the Lowland soldiers,
whose silken standards fluttered gaily above their
moving masses of polished steel caps, their screwed
bayonets, and long pikes, that were ever flashing
in the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
Sir James Hastings' English regiment, and
those of Leven and Mackay belonging to Scotland,
were arrayed in that bright scarlet which
was to become so famous in future wars; but the
battalions of Balfour, Ramsay, and Kenmore wore
the black iron caps, the scarlet hose, and yellow
coats of the Scotch-Dutch brigade.  The cavalry
corps of the Marquis of Annandale and the Lord
Belhaven wore coats of spotless buff and caps of
polished steel.  Their numbers, discipline, and
order would have stricken with dismay any other
volunteers than the Highlanders, whose hearts
had never known fear, and who had long been
accustomed to rout both horse and foot with equal
speed and success.  As the practised eye of Mackay
reconnoitred the position of Dundee, he pointed
to the clan, and said to young Cameron of Locheil,
who rode near him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Behold your father and his wild savages: how
would you like to be with him?"
</p>

<p>
"It matters little," replied the young man
haughtily; "but I recommend you to be prepared,
or my father and his 'wild savages' before night
may be nearer you than you would wish."
</p>

<p>
The reports of a slight skirmish between the
right wing of the Highlanders and Mackay's left,
made the hearts of all beat quicker; and in the
interval, Dundee exchanged his scarlet coat for
one of buff, richly laced with silver; and over it
he tied a scarf of <i>green</i>, which the Highlanders
considered ominous of evil.  Leaping on horseback,
he galloped to the front, and a shout of
impatience burst from the Highland ranks.
</p>

<p>
It was now eight o'clock, and the sun was
dipping behind the hills, when a simultaneous
volley ran from flank to flank along Mackay's
line; and while the roar of the musketry rang
from peak to peak, and rebellowed along the sky
and among the hills like thunder, with a thousand
echoes, Dundee gave the order to charge; and in
deep silence, and like a cloud of battle, the race of
old Selma came down!
</p>

<p>
Reserving their fire until within a pike's length
of King William's troops, the Highlanders poured
upon them a deadly volley; and throwing down
their muskets, drew their claymores, and, under
cover of the smoke, charged with the fury of an
avalanche, striking up the levelled bayonets with
their studded targets, and hewing down with
sword and axe, routed the Lowland soldiery in a
moment.
</p>

<p>
The brave Maclean cut the left wing to pieces;
while Hastings' Englishmen, on the right, had
equal fortune from the Camerons and Macdonalds.
Dunbarton, at the head of sixteen mounted cavaliers,
actually routed the whole artillery, and seized
the cannon; while, led by Finland, the remainder
of the troop broke among the dense and recoiling
mass of Mackay's regiment, riding through it as
easily as through a field of rye.  King William's
Dutch standard was captured by Walter Fenton,
who, after a short conflict, drove his sword through
the corslet of the bearer, and, spurning him with
his foot and stirrup, bore off the trophy.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Finland encountered a mounted
cavalier, and had exchanged blows before he
recognised Craigdarroch, his rival, in the leader of
Annandale's Horse, whom his brave little band
had now assailed, and with whom they were
maintaining a desperate and unequal combat of one to
five.
</p>

<p>
"Surrender, Finland!" said Fergusson haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Have at thee, rebel!" cried his adversary, and
by one blow struck his rapier to pieces.  His
sword was raised to cut down the now defenceless
trooper, and end their rivalry for ever, but,
animated by chivalric generosity, he spared him,
and pressed further on the broken ranks of the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
Carrying aloft the Dutch banner, Walter Fenton
rode towards Dundee, who was applauding Sir
Evan Cameron of Locheil, and urging his clan yet
further to advance.  Dundee (whose panting horse
was in the act of stooping to drink of a mountain
runnel), with his eyes of fire turned to the
disordered masses of Mackay, was brandishing his
sword towards them, when a random bullet pierced
his buff coat above the corslet, and buried itself in
his shoulder under the left arm.
</p>

<p>
The sword dropped from his hand; a deadly
pallor overspread his beautiful features; he reeled
in his saddle, and would have fallen, but Walter
supported him, and held before his eyes the yellow
standard of the Statholder.
</p>

<p>
"Now God be thanked, they fly!" said he, in a
voice which showed how intense were the torments
he endured; "you are a brave lad, Fenton&mdash;the
dying hour of Claver'se is at hand, but he
will not forget you.  Meet me at the house of
Urrard in an hour, if all goes well and I survive
till then.  Make my dutiful service to the noble
Lord Dunbarton, and desire him to assume the
command.  Adieu;" and placing his hand on the
orifice to staunch the blood, he rode over the field
at a rapid trot.
</p>

<p>
In a mass of disorder, horse and foot, musqueteers,
pikemen, and cavalry, the soldiers of Mackay
were driven like a flock of frightened sheep down
the narrow pass, while the fierce clansmen,
swaying with both hands axe and claymore, "cut
down," says an old author, many of Mackay's
officers and soldiers, "through skull and neck to
the very breast; others had their skulls cut off
above their ears like nightcaps; some had their
bodies and crossbelts cut through at one blow;
pikes and swords were cut like willows, and
whoever doubts this may consult the witnesses of the
tragedy."  Thanks to the skill of Dundee and the
valour of the Highlanders, never was a more
decisive victory won.  Mackay lost his tents, baggage,
artillery, provisions, and his standards; he had
two thousand men slain and five hundred taken
prisoners.  Such was the battle of Killycrankie,
or <i>Rinn Ruaradh</i>, as it is still named by the
peasantry, who attribute the ultimately fatal effects
of the victory to the circumstance of Dundee
wearing <i>green</i>, a colour still esteemed ominous to
his sirname.  A rude obelisk of rough stone still
marks the place where the death-shot struck him,
and is pointed out by the mountaineers with
respect and regret as the <i>Tombh Claverse</i>.
</p>

<p>
The grief and consternation that spread through
the Highland ranks on the fall of their beloved
leader becoming known, prevented the pursuit
being followed with sufficient vigour, otherwise
few would ever have reached the southern mouth
of that terrible pass.
</p>

<p>
"Dundee hath assuredly been slain," said
General Mackay, as he breathed his sinking
charger at the other extremity of Killycrankie,
two miles from the field.  "I am convinced of
it; otherwise we would not have been permitted
to retreat thus far unmolested."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
THE LAST HOUR OF DUNDEE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Oh last and best of Scots! who did'st maintain<br />
  Thy country's freedom from a foreign reign;<br />
  New people fill the land, now thou art gone,<br />
  New gods the temples, and new kings the throne!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARCHIBALD PITCAIRN.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now the battle was over, and the fury of the
conflict with the fierce energies it excited had
passed away together.  In that narrow gorge lay
more than two thousand slain, and the broad
round moon, as its shining circle rose above the
dark ridge of the far-off mountains, poured its cold
lustre on the distorted visages of the writhing
wounded, and more ghastly linaments of the pallid
dead.  While the Highlanders were plundering
the baggage and carousing on the provisions of
Mackay (who was then retreating to Stirling),
Walter Fenton rode to the house of Urrard, and
repaired to the presence of his leader.
</p>

<p>
Within a little wainscotted apartment, lighted
by four long candles, that flared in a brazen branch,
stretched upon a low canopied bed lay the great
and terrible Dundee.  On his proud heart of fierce
impulses and high aspirations, the hand of the grim
monarch was now laid surely and heavily.  His
fine features were sharpened, pale and ghastly, by
agony and approaching death.  He breathed
slowly.  His Monmouth wig was laid aside, and
his own raven hair, which formed a strong contrast
with the whiteness of his skin, flowed over
the pillow like the tresses of a woman.
</p>

<p>
"Can this be Claverhouse?" thought Walter.
</p>

<p>
His bloodstained buff coat, his sword and
helmet, lay near him on a chair, and around the
couch were Dunbarton, Finland, the great Sir
Evan of Locheil, Glengarry, Clanronald, Grant of
Glenmorriston, and other leaders, who leaned on
their swords, conversed in low whispers, and
watched with unfeigned sorrow the ebbing life of
the only man who could lead them like Montrose.
</p>

<p>
The whole of his dying energies were now
directed to one object, a despatch to his exiled
king, containing an account of the glories he had
gained in his cause, and the long career of service
he had sealed with his own gallant blood.  Though
every muscle of his face was contracted at times
with the agony he endured, when stretching from
bed to write at the low table beside it, supported
by his brother David Grahame, who was sheathed
in steel, <i>à la Cuirassier</i>, he finished this
memorable and disputed letter with singular coolness,
appended his name, and instantly falling back,
closed his eyes and lay motionless, as if in death.
</p>

<p>
"He is gone," whispered the agitated Earl of
Dunbarton to the stern Locheil.  "There lies the
strongest pillar of the good old cause."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hereditary right will face the rocks!</i>" replied
the chieftain in Gaelic, as he grasped his dirk;
"cursed be the green scarf that wrought this evil
work to Scotland and to us!"
</p>

<p>
Their voices seemed to call back the fleeting
spirit; and, controlling the painful trembling of
his limbs, Dundee opened his bloodshot eyes, and
looked slowly round him.
</p>

<p>
"Do not persist," said he to the surgeon, who
approached.  "I know that all is over&mdash;let me
die in peace.  Approach, Mr. Fenton&mdash;unfurl that
standard;" and his wild dark eyes flashed with
their old energy at the sight of the Stadtholder's
banner.  "You will, at all risks, bear this
despatch and that trophy to the hands of King
James, and say they are the last&mdash;the best&mdash;the
dying bequest of Dundee."
</p>

<p>
Walter's heart was full; he could only lay his
hand upon his breast, and bow a grateful assent.
</p>

<p>
"To Colonel Cannon I bequeath my baton and
authority; let him use them well in the King's
service, if he would wish to die in peace when he
comes to lie <i>here</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Cannon!" muttered the Highland
chiefs, as they drew themselves up, exchanged
glances of hauteur, and twisted their mustachios.
</p>

<p>
"Be merciful to our prisoners," continued the
sufferer in a voice more weak and quavering, and
stopping often to take breath; "be merciful to
them, for they are our countrymen.  Release and
bid them return to their homes in peace; say that
such was the last wish of Dundee.  Many have
styled me merciless in my time, sirs, and bitterly
will they speak of my spirit when it is far beyond
the reach of mortal malevolence.  I have done
fierce and stern things, but I have been hurried to
do them by an irrevocable destiny, and a tide of
circumstances incident to these our troubled times.
Every iota of what I have done was fore-ordained&mdash;hah! do
not your Presbyterians tell us so?
But grateful&mdash;deeply grateful is the conviction to
my passing spirit, that my friends will ever
remember my name with honour, and my foes with fear.
I feel more bitterness in dying after a victory than
I could have endured by a defeat; for <i>it</i> would
have made life worthless, and death welcome.
Oh, may this day's great achievement be an omen
of future success, and a second Restoration!  Go,
my comrades; continue in that path of earthly
glory which I must quit for ever; and let ye who
survive to behold our beloved King fail not to
tell him&mdash;that&mdash;that John Grahame of Claverhouse&mdash;with
his last breath blessed him&mdash;and&mdash;died."
</p>

<p>
Falling back, he immediately expired, just as
daylight (which at that season scarcely passed
away) brightened in the east.
</p>

<p>
All started and bent over him; but the fierce
spirit of that remorseless cavalier had fled for ever,
and his magnificent features, as the rigidity and
pallor of death overspread them, assumed the
aspect of a beautiful marble statue.  A groan that
burst from the lips of his brother, as he knelt
down and closed his eyes; the heavy sobs of a few
aged Highlanders; and the low wail of a lament,
as the pipers of Glengarry poured it to the
mountain-wind and echoing woods of Urrard, were the
only sounds heard within that gloomy chamber,
where the terror of the Presbyterians&mdash;the idol of
the cavaliers, and the last hope of James, lay
prostrate, to rise no more.  Though by one faction
styled the <i>last and best of Scots</i>&mdash;by the other, a
murderer and outlaw; yet, by the cause for which
he died, and the manner of his death, he closed in
glory a life of singular ferocity and turbulence.
</p>

<p>
His remains were hurriedly interred in the rural
kirk of Blair Athol; and the cause of King James
was buried with him.  His brother assumed his
title; but died in great obscurity in France in
1700.  The buff coat of Dundee, bearing the mark
of the fatal ball, and stained with his blood,
together with his helmet and other relics, are still
preserved in the ducal castle of Blair.
</p>

<p>
Remembering the dying desire of their leader
on the day after the battle, the Highland chiefs
liberated all the prisoners on parole of honour not
to serve against the King, Colonel Fergusson of
Craigdarroch (notwithstanding all the exertions
of his generous rival Finland) "being excepted,"
says Captain Crichton, in his Memoirs, "on
account of his more than ordinary zeal for the
new establishment."
</p>

<p>
In those days the uncertain means of communication
between towns, and the great deficiency
of certain information of public events, caused
many strange and varying rumours of the Highland
war to be circulated in the Lowlands, where
the only newspaper was the <i>Caledonius Mercurius</i>,
which had been published occasionally since the
Restoration.  But the astounding intelligence of
the victory at Killycrankie, and the fall of
Dundee, spread like wildfire through the low country,
to which he had so long been a terror and scourge.
The defeat of Cannon at the Haughs of Cromdale,
and the utter prostration of James's banner in the
north, was soon followed by his disaster at the
Boyne, in Ireland, where the loss of a decisive
battle compelled him again to seek refuge in
France.
</p>

<p>
Poor Lilian, at home in the then secluded capital
of Scotland, heard of those stirring events at
long intervals; and to her they were a source of
deep interest, and of many a sigh and hour of
tears; but of Walter she heard no tidings.  Whether
he lay mouldering in the Pass of Killycrankie,
among the haughs of Cromdale, or was wandering
among the wildest fastnesses of the north, with
the doom of proscription and treason hanging
over him, she knew not; and time in no way
soothed or alleviated the agonies of her suspense.
On the return of Colonel Fergusson, whose apostacy
had opened an easy path to preferment under
the new order of affairs, she learned some faint
rumours of his departure to France with the other
officers of Dundee&mdash;for that horizon where the sun
of the exiled Jacobites was setting&mdash;the lonely
palace of St. Germain.  Though the tidings fell
like ice on the heart of the poor girl, any certainty
was preferable to suspense; and with her good Aunt
Grisel, she could only weep for the poor youth they
loved so well, and pray and hope for happier times.
To lighten the solitude his absence caused, she
could not even hope for a letter; all intercourse
with the court of the exiled King being proscribed
under pain of banishment and death; and thus
slowly the melancholy summer of 1690 passed on.
</p>

<p>
With the accession of William, and total subversion
of the old high church party, all the sourness
and severity of Presbyterian discipline (which
at times compelled the proudest peers to endure a
rebuke on the ignominious repentance-stool, or at
least before a congregation) was resumed by the
overbearing clergy in full sway.  From the innate
cavalier sentiments of her family, and the wavering
politics of Aunt Grisel, Lilian had never been
a very rigid Presbyterian; and now, looking upon
the triumph of "the Kirk" as having driven her
lover into exile, she felt her heart further than
ever removed from Presbytery.  She had still to
endure the persecution of Clermistonlee, who,
having in a few months spent all the Revolution
had enabled him to extort by fines from his old
cavalier friends, was now more reduced and desperate
than ever; and, as a last shift, was compelled
to dispose of his tower of Clermiston for a
trifling sum to his more cautious gossip Mersington;
and though the gaming-table replenished his
exchequer at times, gaunt starvation stared him
hourly in the face.
</p>

<p>
Though the native kindness and exceeding
gentleness of Lilian's manner had always given this
indefatigable suitor some hope of ultimate success,
he soon found that, besieging her whenever she
went abroad, and keeping spies upon her when at
home&mdash;pestering her with presents, and letters
the most flattering and submissive his ingenuity
and skill could indite, did not bring him nearer
the summit of his wishes.  As his funds waxed
lower, his perseverance increased; and he brought
a new ally into the field, in the person of our old
friend Mr. Ichabod Bummel, whose zeal for the
Revolution had procured him an incumbency in
the city, where, every Sunday, he had the felicity
of preaching in a pulpit of his own, quoting that
immortal work the <i>Bombshell</i>, railing at the exiled
King, and all other "bloody-minded massmongers,"
and "dinging" many successive bibles to "blads"
in the true Knox-like energy of his discourse.
This meddling preacher, after the abduction of
Lilian, and the scandalous reports the kirk party
had so industriously circulated concerning it, had
long deemed it, in his own phraseology, "a
shameful and malapert fact, unseemly to men, and
abominable in the sight of Heaven, that these
twain should remain unwedded;" and by his
influence, Clermistonlee was duly cited before the
kirk session.  Resistance was in vain, for now
the clergy had succeeded to the Council's iron
rod; and temporal proscription and spiritual
excommunication invariably followed delay.
</p>

<p>
Clad in a sack of coarse white canvass, and on
his knees before a staring congregation of stern
Presbyterians, he "confessit his manifold sins
and enormities," as the records of the kirk show,
"and was rebukit by the godlie Mr. Bummel for
the space of ane hour, being comparit to ane owle
in ye desart;" and it appears that the minister, in
his ire, made such direct reference to the abduction
of Lilian, in language so pointed, so coarse,
and unseemly, that, overwhelmed with shame and
horror, the poor girl, unable to bear the scornful
scrutiny and malevolent glances of her own sex,
sank down in the gloomiest recesses of the old
family pew, and swooned.
</p>

<p>
This event, together with the cruel inuendos
industriously circulated by the gallants and
gossips of the city, was her crowning misfortune;
from that hour her peace was blighted, and her
fair fame blotted for ever.  Her friends pitied
and acquaintance shunned her.  She endured the
most intense grief and bitterness of soul that a
sensitive and delicate woman could feel; for even
the very children of the Whig faction pelted her
sedan when it entered the city, and called her
"My Lord's leman," "Clermistonlee's minion,"
and the "Deil's dearie."
</p>

<p>
The united effects of grief, shame, mortification,
and insulted pride, were soon visible on her health;
her cheek grew blanched and thin, her eyes dim;
and though she did not weep, her sorrows lay
deeper, and the canker-worm preyed upon her
suffering heart.  And not the least offensive to
her feelings were those offerings of friendship
which were mingled with condolence, when Lady
Drumsturdy and others advised her to think
seriously of the long and assiduous attentions of
Clermistonlee; in short, "<i>after all that had taken
place</i>," to receive him as her husband; that being
in their opinion the only way to restore her
forfeited honour.
</p>

<p>
The inuendo concealed under this odious advice
provoked the anger of Lilian, whose concern was
increased by perceiving that Lady Grisel and her
own bosom friend and gossip Annie, were beginning
to be of the same opinion.  Their countenance,
and the hope of Walter's return, had alone
sustained her so long; but now a sense of utter
desolation sank upon her soul, and her brain
reeled with the terrible thoughts that oppressed it.

CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
ST. GERMAINS.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  And it was a' for our richtfu' king,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ere left Scotia's strand, my dear;<br />
  And it was a' for our richtfu' king,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw another land, my dear.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OLD SONG.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Agitated by feelings such as few have
experienced, on an evening in the summer of 1690,
Walter Fenton found himself pursuing the dusty
highway from Paris to St. Germains, the place
where the hopes and the fears, the loyalty and
the sorrows of the Jacobites were centred.  He
wore a plain suit of unlaced grey cloth, very much
worn, a hat without a feather, and a plain
walking-sword.  He carried under his arm a small
bundle, with particular care, for it contained a
few necessaries and all he possessed in the
world&mdash;his commission, the long-treasured letter of
Dundee, and the Dutch standard he had taken at
Killycrankie.  These were now his whole fortune.
</p>

<p>
That day he had walked from Senlis without
tasting food, and was quite exhausted.  After
spending his last sou on a glass of sour vin
ordinaire at a small cottage near the Wood of Treason
(where Ganelon in 780 formed his plot which
betrayed the house of Ardennes, the peers of
Charlemagne, and occasioned the defeat at
Roncesvalles), he grasped his bundle, and pushed on
with renewed energy.  His handsome features
were impressed by an air of sadness and deep
abstraction, for the acute achings of present
sorrow struggled with the gentler whisperings of
hope, and though his feet traversed the hard flinty
roadway from Paris, his thoughts were far away
in the land of his childhood, and his wandering
fancy luxuriated on the memory of many a much-loved
scene he might be fated to behold no more,
and many an episode of tenderness and love that
would never be re-acted again.
</p>

<p>
How vividly he recalled every glance and graceful
action of Lilian, as he had last beheld her.
Nearest and dearest to his heart, she rendered
the memory of his native land still more beloved,
for she yet trod its soil and breathed its air, and
he knew that daily she could gaze on those blue
hills which are the first landmarks of the child in
youth, and the last of the man in age, and to the
recollection of which the emigrant and the exile
cling with the tenacity of life.
</p>

<p>
The current of his thoughts was interrupted,
and his cheek flushed.  The great and striking
brick façade of the old castle of St. Germains,
with its turrets shining in the setting sun, arose
before him.  There dwelt he on whom the hopes
of half a nation rested, and Walter drew breath
more freely as he progressed; his eye sparkled,
and his cheek flushed with animation, for now
other and less painful thoughts were occurring to
his fancy.  With the buoyancy natural to youth,
sorrow gave way as hope spread its rainbow before
him: and bright visions of the King's triumphant
return and restoration by the swords of the
Cavaliers or Jacobites, mingled with his own dreams
of love and honour.  Fired with ardour, he often
grasped his sword, and springing forward, longed
to throw himself at the foot of James VII., and
pour forth in transport that singularly deep and
burning passion of loyalty which animated every
member of his faction.
</p>

<p>
"And this is the palace of our King!" he
exclaimed, with enthusiasm.  "Heaven grant I
may yet greet him in his old ancestral dome of
Holyrood!"  But the fever of his naturally excitable
spirits subsided when approaching the edifice,
for the air of silence and gloom that pervaded it
struck a chill on his anxious heart.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," thought he, "if James should be dead!"
</p>

<p>
At the distance of twelve miles from Paris, this
ancient brick chateau or palace is beautifully
situated on the slope of a verdant hill, at the base
of which flows the Seine, and opposite lies an
immense forest.  From the earliest ages,
St. Germain-en-laye had been a hunting-seat of the French
kings; but in compliment to his mistress, whose
name was Diana, Francis I. (a monarch unequalled
in gallantry, generosity, and magnificence) built
the present palace in form of the letter D, with
five towers, the vanes of which were gleaming like
gold in the setting sun as Walter approached.  A
dry fosse crossed by drawbridges surrounded this
noble chateau, which had on one side a range of
beautiful arcades built by Henry IV. and Louis
XIII., and a magnificent terrace 2,700 yards long
and 50 broad, extending by the side of the dark-green
forest, and from which, as our exile traversed
it, he had a full view of the Seine winding through
a beautiful country, bordered on each side by
waving meadows, vineyards of the deepest green,
and cornfields of the brightest yellow, villages of
white cottages thatched with light-coloured straw,
that clustered round the turreted chateaux or the
ramparted châtelets of a noblesse that were then
the most aristocratic in Europe.
</p>

<p>
But Walter saw only the home of the exiled
Stuarts.  On the ruddy brick-walls, the latticed
casements, and gothic towers, the setting sun was
pouring a flood of light as it set at the cloudless
horizon.  From the summit of the edifice, the
royal standard of Britain hung down listlessly and
still, and the same absence of life seemed to
pervade all beneath it.  The ditch was overgrown
with luxuriant weeds, and long tufts of pendant
grass waved in the joints of the masonry; great
branches of vine and ivy had clambered up the
walls of the palace, and flourished in masses on its
terraced roofs and balconies.  There was no one
visible at any of the windows; the gateway, which
was surmounted by a stone salamandre (the
cognizance of Francis I.), was shut, and save two
sentinels of the French guards, who stood motionless
as statues on each side, and an old Jacobite
gentleman or two, in full-bottomed wigs and laced
coats, promenading slowly and thoughtfully on
the terrace, the old chateau seemed lifeless and
uninhabited.
</p>

<p>
As Walter crossed the bridge, and approached
the gate with a beating heart, one of the sentinels,
after giving a haughty glance at his faded and
travel-stained attire, his weary aspect, and bundle,
ported his musquet across, and said politely, but
firmly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Pardonnez, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
Walter's heart swelled: had he travelled thus
far, and reached the palace of his King, only to be
repulsed from its gates?  His colour came and
went, as, with a painful mixture of pride and
humility, he replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mon camarade, I am a poor Scots officer,
exiled from his native country, and who has come
here to take service in France."  The face of the
Frenchman flushed, and his eye glistened, as he
drew himself up, and presented arms.
</p>

<p>
"Behold my commission," continued Walter;
"I would speak with my noble Lord and Colonel
the Earl of Dunbarton."
</p>

<p>
"Aha," replied the sentinel, "il est bon
soldat, Monsieur Dunbartong.  Passez, Monsieur
officier; un gentilhomme est toujours un
gentilhomme, et les braves officiers Eccossais sonts
l'admiration de la France!"
</p>

<p>
Walter bowed at this compliment, the gate was
opened by the porters, and, with a heart full of
thoughts too deep for words, he found himself
within the gloomy quadrangle of the palace of
St. Germain-en-laye.
</p>

<p>
Left for some minutes to himself, he stood,
bundle in hand, irresolutely surveying, with a
dejected and crest-fallen air, the great and silent
court.  A gentleman in very plain attire, with a
short wig, a well-worn beaver, and steel-hilted
sword, who was slowly promenading under the
arcade, suddenly turned, and the wanderer was
greeted by his old friend Finland.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome to the poor cheer of St. Germain-en-laye!"
cried this merry soldier (whom no fall
of fortune could daunt), grasping Walter's hand.
"My bon camarade, welcome to France.  By all
the devils, I was often grieved for thee, poor lad,
and deemed thou wert doing penance in some
rascally Tolbooth for our brave camisade in the
north."
</p>

<p>
Walter was so much oppressed in spirit, and
so weak in mind and body, that the tears rushed
into his eyes, and he could only press his hand in
silence.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil&mdash;&mdash;my poor lad, thou seemest
very faint and exhausted!"
</p>

<p>
"I have travelled on foot from Boulogne-sur-mer.
I spent my last franc at St. Juste, my last
sou an hour ago for a glass of vin ordinaire, and
for three days no food has passed my lips."
</p>

<p>
"My God!" exclaimed Finland, striking his
flushed forehead, "and my last tester went for
dinner today! how shall I assist you?  Travelling
for three days without food!  Surely the fortunes
of the cavaliers are now at the lowest ebb."
</p>

<p>
"Then the tide must flow again."
</p>

<p>
"I now begin to fear it will flow no more for
us.  What says the player?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'There is a tide in the affairs of men,<br />
  Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Once at least in life, every man's fortune will be
at the flood, and if he misses the tide his bark is
stranded on the shore for ever.  But thee, poor
lad! how shall I get thee food?&mdash;we are all as poor
as kirk rats here.  There are not less than two
hundred officers of Dundee's army, and other
loyal gentlemen of the Life Guards and Scottish
Brigade, subsisting here on the small bounty of
our gracious king, (whom Heaven in its mercy
bless!) until some turn of fortune again draws
forth their swords.  We have each but fourpence
a day, and are in great misery from lack of the
most common necessaries of life.  Yet we never
forget that we are Scottish gentlemen, and daily
attend the king's levée, with as gallant an air as
if we trod the long gallery of Holyrood in our
feathers and lace as of old.  His grace of Gordon,
my Lords of Maitland, Dunbarton, Abercorn,
and others dine daily at a poor Restaurateur's, on
plain stew and cabbage broth, while I have to
content myself with bread and onions, and a keen
appetite for sauce; while it affords me no
consolation to reflect that my old ancestral tower of
Finland&mdash;the gift of the Black Douglas to his
favourite son&mdash;and all the fertile lands that spread
around it, are now possessed by some vile, canting,
crop-ear.  The Earl of Dunbarton&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Whilom our gallant colonel&mdash;how I long for
an interview!"
</p>

<p>
"He is gone to Versailles to visit le Mareschal
Noailles, anent the unfortunate gentlemen who
are starving here around us.  He will be back
tomorrow.  Oh, Walter, when I see how might can
triumph over right, and wickedness over more
than Spartan virtue, I am almost tempted to
believe there is no governing power in this
wretched world; that all is the effect of chance or
fate."
</p>

<p>
"Chance and fate are the reverse of each other,
and this sentiment agrees not with your previous
idea of 'the tide in the affairs of men.'"
</p>

<p>
"Tush!  I am in a dozen minds in an hour.  Let
us leave these topics to such men as Mr. Ichabod
Bummel.  You remember that apostle of the
covenant?  ha, ha!  A word in your ear.  You
saw our fair ones ere you left Scotland, I doubt
not?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas, no."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce! how came that to pass?  But you
must dine, and where? for I have not a brass
bodle, as we say at home in poor old Scotland,
(God bless her, with all her errors!) I have it!
the officer of the guard will lend me&mdash;or give&mdash;'tis
all one; they are fine fellows, these French, and
share their poor pay with us, in a spirit of charity
that the apostles could not have surpassed.  The
gentleman and the soldier seldom seek a boon
from each other in vain."
</p>

<p>
Finland calculated rightly; the French chevalier
commanding the guard, on learning the cause of
his present necessity, at once divided the contents
of his purse, and enabled the happy borrower to
lead his wearied friend to a tavern, where dinner
was ordered and discussed with wonderful celerity.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Walter, I shall be glad to hear thy
adventures," said Finland, when the waiting girl
had cleared the dinner board and laid a decanter
of wine, from which he filled their glasses.
"Frontiniac dashed with brandy&mdash;you remember
how often we have drank a bottle of it at Hughie
Blair's, and the White Horse Hostel.  How the
times are changed since then!  I was not at the
Haughs o' Cromdale, being en route for Ireland to
crave succour from James&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"After the dispersion consequent to that
ill-managed affair, I wandered from place to place,
enduring such miseries as few can conceive, and
was a thousand times in danger of being captured
by Mackay's dragoons, who were riding down the
country in every direction.  Assisted by the kind
and beautiful Countess of Dunbarton (who is yet
intriguing in England), I procured some money,
and, disguised as a Norlan drover, reached the
western borders, for escape by sea from Scotland
was impossible, the whole coast being watched by
the English and Dutch fleet.  In England my
money was soon spent, and I despaired of ever
reaching the port of Colchester, where I heard
there lay a ship that in secret frequently
transported our persecuted people to France.  My
bonnet and grey plaid, though they ensured my
safety in the Lowlands, caused me to be viewed
with hatred, jealousy, and mistrust, as soon as the
Cheviot hills were left behind me, and I had not
money wherewith to procure a change of costume.
I travelled principally by night, and slept in
ditches or thickets by day, for the villagers
assailed me with stones and abuse whenever they
saw me, using every bitter epithet that national
animosity could inspire, while every country boor
that had a couple of beagles at hand, uncoupled
them to track and hunt me."
</p>

<p>
"Would to heaven I had been with thee, lad!
Well."
</p>

<p>
"I remember with what bitterness I changed
my last penny for a poor roll at Rippon, and eat
it by the side of a ditch, near the princely castle
of one who had gained a coronet by his political
apostacy.  I had still many miles before me, but
trusting to Providence, continued my journey.
Travelling by night and lying <i>perdu</i> by day, I
found myself in a waste moorland near Cawood,
in the West Riding of Yorkshire.  The moon was
rising; but I found that hunger, fatigue, and
humiliation, had done their worst upon me, and
that I could achieve no more.  Despair entered
my heart, and I threw myself down in that bleak
spot to die, cursing the rebellion of our countrymen,
the inhospitality of the English, and my own
bad fortune.  From a stupor that for some time
weighed down every sense, I was roused by the
trampling of a horse, and a deep bass voice crying,
</p>

<p>
"'Hollo Gaffer, art dead, or dead drunk only!
Get up with a murrain, for my nag will neither
stand or pass; steady&mdash;so-so&mdash;gently, zounds! gently!"
</p>

<p>
"I started, and instinctively grasped my staff,
on perceiving a tall stout fellow muffled in a dark
rocquelaure, with his face masked, and a hat
flapped over his eyes.  He rode a strong, fleet,
and active horse, and carried long holsters.
</p>

<p>
"'Crush me, if it isn't a Scotch Jockey&mdash;a
pedlar, I warrant!' said he, drawing a pistol from
his saddlebow; 'they never travel without the
ready; so hand over the bright Jacobuses or
William's guilders, or else I may pop this bullet
through your brain.'
</p>

<p>
"I was desperate, and replied, 'Fire! and rid
me of an existence that is worthless.  I have
nothing to give but my life, and it is no longer
of value to me.'
</p>

<p>
"'A gentleman, by this light!' replied the
other, withdrawing his pistol, 'some cavalier in
disguise, I warrant.'
</p>

<p>
"'You have guessed rightly; so now lead me to
the nearest justice of the peace for a reward, if you
will.'
</p>

<p>
"'For what do you take me?' said he, angrily.
'God bless King James, and may the great devil
choak his son-in-law!  Ah, had the good Dundee
(a Scot though he was) survived that brave day's
work, in your infernal pass of what d'ye call it?
'twould have been another case with us both
today, perhaps.  So thou art a Scottish cavalier?'
</p>

<p>
"'Once I was so&mdash;to-night I am a beggar,
perishing by want, and without a roof to shelter
me.'
</p>

<p>
"'Hast thou no money, lad?'
</p>

<p>
"'Not a penny, and have two hundred miles to
travel.'
</p>

<p>
"'Hast thou no friends among the English here?'
</p>

<p>
"'Have I not said that I am poor?'
</p>

<p>
"'Right!  I have learned in my time that the
poor have no friends.'
</p>

<p>
"'Save God and their own hands.'
</p>

<p>
"'Right again, say I; though a highwayman, I
love thee lad, for we have suffered in common from
this accursed usurper, who sits in the throne of
of our king.  Here are thirty guineas; 'tis the half
of all I have in the world, but to-morrow night
may bring me better luck; take them with
welcome, and spend them without scruple; but two
hours ago, they were in the purse of that rascally
whig, Marmaduke Langstone, of Langstone Hall.
Keep to the right, and an hour's brisk walking
will bring you to a hedge alehouse.  Whisper my
name to the wench at the bar (kiss her for me),
and she will put thee on the right road for
Colchester; the girl is true as steel to the good old
cause.'
</p>

<p>
"'Whom shall I thank&mdash;whom remember?'
</p>

<p>
"'They call me "Highflying Tom" now, eastward
of Temple Bar,' said he in a tone of bitterness;
'but when King James sat in his own chair, I was
Thomas Butler, <i>Esquire</i>, of a long pedigree and an
empty purse&mdash;devil else&mdash;but a gentleman every
inch, sir; one that has shot his man, played at
Cavagnole with King Charles, and Ombre with
the Queen; drank many a bout with Rochester,
ruffled it with Buckingham, and handed the fair
Castlemaine and fairer Cleveland through a crowded
cotillon.  But it's all over now; and, d&mdash;n me!
I am plain Bully Butler the highwayman.&mdash;So,
sir, your servant;' and dashing spurs into his
horse, he galloped away over the heath."
</p>

<p>
"Thomas Butler, of the princely house of
Ormond&mdash;and 'twas he!" said Finland; "a braver
spark old Ireland never sent forth to glory or
disgrace.  His father was a stout old Royalist, and
shed his blood for King James on the banks of the
Boyne.  And so he hath taken to the road, the
madcap!  That is riding at the gallows full tilt
with a vengeance!"
</p>

<p>
"But for that rencontre, I must have expired.
The meeting gave me renewed energy; and (to be
brief) I reached&mdash;not Colchester, but the sea-port
of Saltfleet, where, in the disguise of a poor
Scottish mariner, I embarked on board a smuggling
craft, which landed me at Boulogne; and so&mdash;I
am here."

CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE CAVALIERS OF DUNDEE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  In the cause of right engaged,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrongs injurious to redress;<br />
  Honour's war we strongly waged,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the heavens denied success.<br />
  Ruin's wheel has driven o'er us,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a hope that dare attend;<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The magnanimity of those unfortunate officers
of the Scottish army who remained loyal to James
VII., and had shared his misfortunes and exile,
was equally worthy of ancient Caledonia and of
the most glorious ages of Athens and of Sparta.
They were about one hundred and fifty in number,
all men of noble spirit, unblemished honour,
and high birth; for they were the representatives
of some of the first families in Scotland.
Enthusiastically attached to the King, they gloried in
the sufferings their principles had brought upon
them.
</p>

<p>
On their first arrival in France, small pensions
were assigned them by Louis XIV.; but these
were shortly afterwards withdrawn, on the paltry
pretext of public expedience; and the whole of
those unfortunate gentlemen, who by their
incorruptible loyalty and indomitable patriotism had
forfeited their commissions, when they might
have purchased new honours in the ranks of the
invader, and many of whom had lost titles and
estates by their expatriation, were thus thrown
destitute in a foreign land.
</p>

<p>
It is related that, with a noble spirit of generosity,
they shared their little funds for the benefit
of those who were in greater destitution; and
those who had raised money by the sale of their
gilt corslets, jewels, laced uniforms, rings, &amp;c.,
readily shared it with others who were penniless.
But these occasional funds soon became exhausted;
the King soon found it impossible, from the
pittance allowed him, to maintain the numerous
exiles and ruined dependants who made his court
of St. Germain their rallying point.  The poor
Scottish officers finding the horrors of starvation
before them, petitioned James for leave to form
themselves into a company of private soldiers for
the service of the French king, asking no other
favour than permission to choose their own leaders:
their former general, Dunbarton, to be their captain;
their Serjeants to be lieutenant-colonels; and
so forth.  The King reluctantly consented.
</p>

<p>
Those high-spirited cavaliers were immediately
furnished with the clothing and arms of French
soldiers; and previously to their incorporation
with the army of Mareschal Noailles, repaired to
St. Germain, to be reviewed by the King, and to
take a long&mdash;to many a last&mdash;adieu of him.
</p>

<p>
It was the day after Walter's arrival; and the
summer morning rose beautifully on the Gothic
towers of St. Germain, the crystal windings of
the Seine, and on the dense dark woodlands that,
interspersed with blooming vineyards and waving
fields, imparted such charms to the landscape.
</p>

<p>
James VII. had become passionately fond of
the chase since the loss of his kingdom; for his
brave and restless spirit always sought excitement
when not absorbed in the austere duties of religion,
in the course of which he often subjected himself
to the most severe penances.  Kind, affable, and
easy to all around him, religion improved the
virtues of his heart, subdued the fire of his spirit,
and by imparting a monk-like gentleness to his
demeanour, endeared him to his enthusiastic
followers.  The butcheries of Kirke and Claverhouse,
and the tyrannies of Jefferies and Rosehaugh, were
forgotten.  Though his uncompromising bigotry
remained, all his arbitrary spirit had vanished;
and when he laid aside his visions of worldly
grandeur and kingly power, nothing could be more
blameless and amiable than the life he led.
</p>

<p>
He frequently visited the poor monks of La
Trappe, whom he surprised by the piety and
humility of his deportment; but there were times
when the sparkling eye, the flushed cheek, the
forward stride, and the clanked sword, shewed
how regal a spirit and bold a heart misfortune had
crushed and fanaticism clouded.  He was an
enthusiast in the pleasures of the chase, which he
enjoyed after the good old English fashion; and
on the morning in question, the baying of dogs,
the neighing of horses, and the merry ringing of
the clear bugle-horn, awoke the echoes of the
woods, the gloomy arcades, and quadrangle of
St. Germain.
</p>

<p>
On each side of the archway were drawn up a
guard of honour of les Gardes Françaises, in their
white hoquetons laced with gold, powdered wigs,
little hats looped on three sides and surmounted
with plumes of feathers, and having the white
banner of Bourbon displayed.  The porters
unclosed the heavy folding-doors, and a merry troop
of huntsmen in green galloped forth, with their
dogs barking and straining in the leashes, as the
blasts of the shrill horns were poured to the
morning wind, and roused their English blood.  The
heavy drawbridge clanked into its place across the
grass-grown moat&mdash;the planks resounded to iron
hoofs&mdash;the French guard presented arms&mdash;the
oriflamme of St. Denis was lowered&mdash;the drums
beat a march&mdash;and James VII., raising his plumed
hat, sallied forth at the head of his train, and
advanced along the spacious and magnificent terrace.
The Earl of Dunbarton rode by his side; and as
they caracoled along the level terrace, by the
margin of the beautiful Seine, a body of soldiers
in French uniform was seen in front, drawn up
in steady array, with their fixed bayonets shining
in the morning sun.  They presented arms as the
King approached, upon which he immediately
reined up, and raised his hat.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord Dunbarton," said he, "what troops
are these?"
</p>

<p>
"They are your Majesty's most faithful subjects
and devoted followers," replied Dunbarton in a
faltering voice.  "Yesterday they were Scottish
gentlemen of coat-armour and bearers of your
Majesty's commission&mdash;to-day they are but poor
privates in the army of Louis of France."
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said the King; "and, in the levity
of the chase, am I so oblivious of the misfortunes
of those unhappy gentlemen?"
</p>

<p>
Instantly leaping from his horse with a heart
that swelled by its emotions, he approached them
and raised his hat.
</p>

<p>
Every heart was full in that silent line before
him, and every eye glistened.  Walter Fenton,
who now for the first time beheld that King for
whom he had suffered so much, felt his bosom
glow with the most intense loyalty and ardour,&mdash;a
gush of sentiment that would have enabled him
to hail with joy the terrors of a scaffold or the
dangers of a battle-field.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said the King, "bitter though
my own misfortunes be, yours lie nearer my heart,
which is grieved, beyond what language can express,
to behold so many men of valour and worth, from
being the officers of my Scottish army, reduced
by their loyalty to the station of private soldiers.
Nothing but this more than Spartan devotion on
the part of the few, but gallant and leal, makes my
life worth preserving.  Deeply, deeply indeed is
my heart impressed with the sense of all you have
undergone for my sake; and if it should ever please
the blessed God"&mdash;(removing his hat)&mdash;"to restore
me to the throne of my fathers, your sufferings,
your services, and your devotion shall not be
forgotten&mdash;never, oh, never!  The prince my
son, he shares your northern blood.  Oh, may
he likewise inherit your spirit of bravery and
truth!
</p>

<p>
"At your own desire, gentlemen, you are now
going on a long and perilous march, far distant
from me, to encounter privation, danger, and
death.  To the utmost of my small means, I have
provided you with money, shoes, and stockings.
Heaven knoweth how great are my own necessities.
I can no more.....
</p>

<p>
"Fear God&mdash;love one another, and you will
ever find me your parent, if I cannot be your
King."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of James VII. were full of tears, and
a long pause ensued.
</p>

<p>
"There is a gentleman here who arrived only
yesterday," said Lord Dunbarton, who had also
dismounted.  "He is the bearer of two relics to
your Majesty: the first is the despatch of the
expiring Dundee; the second will bear witness of
his own zeal and courage in your cause at the
victory of Killycrankie."
</p>

<p>
"Let him approach," said the king, covering
his face to hide his emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Fenton," said the Earl, "His Majesty
would speak with you," and Walter, whose heart
trembled from the depth of his emotions, grounded
his musquet, and, kneeling before James, placed
in his hands the long-treasured despatch of
Dundee, and the Dutch standard of Mackay's regiment.
</p>

<p>
"My brave Dundee!" exclaimed James, in a
low voice, as he kissed and perused the brief
letter which had been hurriedly penned amid the
agonies of death; "'tis stained with his loyal and
noble blood!  Oh! never had a king a subject
more devoted, more loyal, or more true!  Accept
my thanks, young gentleman, for the services you
have performed, the valour you have displayed,
and the fidelity you evince; accept my thanks,
for misfortune has left me nothing else wherewith
to reward the faithful and the brave, who have
followed me to exile and obscurity.  This standard
I will retain; one day, perhaps, in Holyrood
or Windsor, I may replace it in your hands with
such rewards as a king alone can give."
</p>

<p>
Walter strove to speak, but his voice failed him,
on which Lord Dunbarton said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Like his brothers in misfortune, my young
friend seeks no other reward than the honour of
serving your Majesty, and the satisfaction of doing
that which is right."
</p>

<p>
The King drew his sword.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name, Sir!" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Fenton&mdash;Walter Fenton, of Dunbarton's Foot."
</p>

<p>
"No kinsman, I hope, of Fenton of that ilk,
who is so active in his treason against us?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas, no!" replied Walter, colouring in
painful humility; "may it please your Majesty I am
but a poor protegée of the noble Dunbarton.  I
know not my family, my name, or my origin."
</p>

<p>
"It matters not&mdash;I shall render honour to all
who deserve it; arise <i>Sir</i> Walter Fenton, Knight
Banneret&mdash;of this power, at least, my son William
cannot deprive me."
</p>

<p>
Startled by the suddenness of the action,
Walter, whose heart leaped within him at the words
of the King, could only kiss his hand and resume
his place in the ranks of his cavalier comrades,
who with difficulty repressed a shout of applause.
Walter felt giddy and confused; the King still
seemed to be addressing him.
</p>

<p>
The temporary excitement which had led James
through this painful interview, now passed away,
and his features became overclouded with a sad
and bitter expression, as he went slowly along the
line asking each officer his name, inserting it in
his note book, and returning him personal thanks.
Meanwhile the troop of huntsmen, equerries, and
whippers-in, with their packs of panting-hounds,
were grouped about the terrace, and quite forgotten
in the excitement of this sorrowful review.
</p>

<p>
"Your name, Sir&mdash;yesterday you were at my
levée in a garb more suitable to your rank," said
James, to a tall and very handsome man, whose
fashionably curled wig consorted ill with the coarse
looped hat and plain blue coat of a French
musqueteer; "your name, Sir, if you please?"
</p>

<p>
"John Ogilvie, of the house of Airly&mdash;late a
captain in your Majesty's Life Guard."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I thank you&mdash;the day may come when
you shall command that Life Guard," replied
James, writing down his name; "and yours, Sir?"
he asked of the next.
</p>

<p>
"Grant of Dunlugais&mdash;a captain of Mar's Fusiliers."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have lost an estate in my service?"
</p>

<p>
"I have lost nothing that I can regret in such
a cause."
</p>

<p>
"May I live to requite it!  'Tis an ancient
house, and one of unblemished honour.  Are you
Catholic?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am a Presbyterian."
</p>

<p>
"Then the greater honour is due to you for
disinterested loyalty.  And yours, Sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Douglas of Finland&mdash;a lieutenant under the
Lord Dunbarton."
</p>

<p>
"Another forfeiture!" exclaimed James, striking
his breast; "and yours, Sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Drumquhasel&mdash;first major to the same noble
earl," replied the tali cavalier, on whose breast
sparkled the cross of St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
"Another, and another!  Oh, gentlemen, your
sufferings and your losses, your loyalty and your
truth&mdash;God may requite them adequately, but I
never can!" exclaimed James, in a troubled voice,
and when he had inserted the names of the whole
hundred and fifty in his note book, he moved
again to the front, and taking off his hat, bowed
profoundly with an air in which thankfulness and
respect were exquisitely blended with dignity and
majesty.  He then retired pensively towards the
palace; but painfully aware of the misery of those
who suffered for him, and still unwilling to leave
them, with sensations too deep for utterance, the
unhappy King returned once more, and bowing
to them again and again, covered his face with
his handkerchief, and burst into tears.  Animated
by one sympathetic impulse, the whole line sank
at once upon their knees and bowed their heads;
the spirit of many a brave man was subdued;
several wept, and there was not an unmoistened
eye among them.  The King, in particular, was
deeply affected; his sobs were audible; and again
removing his hat, he raised his eyes to heaven,
and exclaimed, in the words of the last chapter of
Lamentations,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us!
Consider and behold our reproach!  <i>Our inheritance
is returned to strangers&mdash;our houses to
aliens!</i>"
</p>

<p>
He repeatedly smote himself upon the breast in
an energetic fashion he had acquired among the
Jesuits, who had been too much about him for his
own fortune; and a long pause succeeded, until Lord
Dunbarton gave for the last time the word of
command.  The Scottish officers resumed their aspect
of steadiness and order, and marched past the
King, whom nearly all of them were fated to
behold no more; for death on the field, disease in
the camp, poverty and despair, did their work
surely and rapidly, and few of that brave but
forlorn band ever returned from the frontiers of
Spain.
</p>

<p>
From Versailles this company of unfortunate
cavaliers received an order to join the army of
Mareschal Noailles; and, next day, they set out
from St. Germain, on their long and weary march
of nine hundred miles, which they performed
on foot, heavily accoutred, bearing their own
camp-kettles and equipages, and accompanied by
miseries and mortifications that baffle all
description; but which, by the indomitable spirit and
ardour that animated them, they seldom failed to
surmount.
</p>

<p>
Louis of France was now plunged in a war, into
which his mistaken policy had hurried him.  In
a long persecution of the unhappy Protestants,
he had weakened his kingdom by the expatriation
of thousands of his best and most industrious
subjects, who wandered as refugees throughout
other countries, and justly inflamed all Europe
against him.  To crush him, there had been
formed at Augsburg a powerful league, to which
the whole empire of Germany, Spain, Holland,
Savoy, Sweden, and Denmark were parties; but,
in no way daunted, he anticipated this great
confederation by invading the empire and laying siege
to Philipsburg.  The recent revolution in England
had given a new turn to this religious war, and
Ireland became the theatre of a contest which
ended on the banks of the Boyne, where William
triumphed over his unfortunate father-in-law.
</p>

<p>
It may be that the great expenses of the war in
which he was now involved prevented Louis XIV. from
remunerating adequately to their merit the
officers of Dundee's army; but when they joined
the standard of Noailles on the Spanish frontier,
they were in a state of lamentable destitution and
misery.  The coarse uniform in which they had
marched from St. Germain was worn to rags;
they were shoeless, shirtless, and emaciated by
hardships, privations, and want of the most common
necessaries of life; for by the selfishness and
duplicity of individuals to whom their little
commissariat was entrusted, they were cheated of their
poor supplies, the few presents the generous had
sent them, and even of a small pittance (a few
pence daily) which James, amid all his own
necessities, endeavoured to pay them; yet they were
never known to utter a complaint, for the
misfortunes of their sovereign pressed heavier on
their hearts than their own.
</p>

<p>
Wherever they marched they were beheld with
pity and remembered with sorrow.  The kind
ladies of Perpignan presented them with a purse
containing 200 pistoles, and bought all their rings
as relics of <i>les officiers Ecossais</i>.  "Wherever
they passed they were received with tears by the
women and admiration by the men.  They were
the foremost in the battle, and the last in retreat,
and of all the troops in the service of France they
were most obedient to orders."
</p>

<p>
There is nothing in the history of ancient or
modern times to equal their admirable bearing,
heroic ardour, and devoted loyalty.  They endured
the most severe humiliation and privations without
uttering a murmur, and performed actions of
heroism outdoing the deeds of romance; for to
their inborn daring was united a spirit of desperation,
and a longing to be honorably rid of a life
that was without a charm and without a ray of
hope.
</p>

<p>
The French were touched by their misfortunes
and sufferings; a universal shout rent the camp
of Noailles on their marching into it, and with
that generosity which is so characteristic of
soldiers, the chevaliers and officers immediately
subscribed for them, each furnishing shirts, clothing,
and money, and none was more liberal with his
purse than the noble Mareschal himself; but even
of these presents the unhappy Scots officers were
cheated by the villany of one to whom they were
entrusted, and thus the kind efforts to alleviate
their miseries failed.
</p>

<p>
On the route to Catalonia, near Montpelier,
when fording a mountain torrent swollen by the
recent rains, Walter Fenton and three other
cavaliers were swept away.  Catching hold of some
alders that overhung the bank, they kept
themselves above the current, and called on the
peasantry to save them.  It is related, that though
hundreds were there looking on, they never offered
the least assistance, but mocked and jibed them in
barbarous Catalonian French, while waiting coolly
until they were drowned, that they might possess
their money, clothes, and arms.  But after great
toil and danger they were rescued by their
comrades.
</p>

<p>
They were never seen on the field but with
their faces to the enemy.  On every desperate
duty and forlorn hope they led the way, and often
too where others dared not <i>follow</i>.  Death and
disease rapidly thinned their ranks, but their
ardour never failed, and had the invisible spirit of
the fierce Dundee led them as of old, they could
not have surpassed the deeds they achieved and
the glory they acquired.  On Rosas surrendering,
</p>

<p>
"<i>Senor Mariscal</i>," said the Spanish governor,
"what soldiers were those who assailed the breach
so valiantly?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ces sont mes enfans</i>," replied Noailles, smiling;
"they are my children&mdash;the King of Britain's
Scottish officers, who share his obscurity and exile,
and do me the honor to serve under my command."
</p>

<p>
"By St. James! <i>they alone</i> have compelled me
to surrender," replied the noble Spaniard.
</p>

<p>
They marched from Rosas to Piscador, and, of
an army of 26,000 men, 16,000 perished by the
way-side of privation.  Twice only the Scottish
officers were known to disobey orders.  The first
occasion was at the siege of Rosas, an ancient and
well fortified city, situated upon a gulf about
twelve miles from Girona.  The air was intensely
hot, and the water muddy and unwholesome; the
only rations of the Scots officers were horse-beans,
garlic, and sardinas; they were utterly penniless,
and could procure no better food, consequently
deadly fevers and fluxes rapidly thinned their ranks,
upon which Mareschal Noailles ordered them to
leave the camp for the purpose of cantoning in a
more healthy locality; but they delayed to obey, and
sent Sir Walter Fenton to acquaint him that they
"considered his order as an affront put upon them
as soldiers of fortune and gentlemen of honour."
</p>

<p>
The second instance was when a strong body of
German troops had made a lodgement on an island
in the Rhine, from which it was necessary to force
them; the Marquis de Selle ordered a number of
boats to be prepared, under an impression that the
river was too deep and rapid to be fordable, and
the Scottish officers were to lead the way, but
were not to move until orders were given to
embark.  Finding it impossible to restrain their
ardour till the arrival of the boats, they slung their
musquets and prepared to cross.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Walter!" exclaimed the brave
Douglas as he led the way, "and we will shew
these gay chevaliers of France that we, who have
forded the rapid Spey and rocky Forth, need not
shrink on the margin of the Rhine.  Join hands,
gentlemen Scots; forward! and I will lead you to
the dance.  Hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
Hand in hand, in the Highland fashion, with
their musquets slung, they threw themselves into
the rapid and impetuous stream, where between
jagged rocks it urged its foamy way over a slippery
and stony bed; and thus breaking its force they
stemmed the current, and, though under a fierce
cannonade and storm of musquet balls poured on
them from the rocks of the islet, they forced the
dangerous passage in the view of both armies; the
Laird of Drumquhasel and Captain Ogilvie* were
shot dead; but, led on by Finland, the Scottish
officers scaled the rocks, and assailing ten times
their number of Germans with screwed bayonets
and clubbed musquets, drove them from their
intrenchments into the Rhine on the other side of
the island, and reared the French standard on its
summit.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Captain Ogilvie was author of a song, which is preserved in
Hogg's Jacobite reliques,&mdash;"<i>Adieu for evermore.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"By St. Denis!" exclaimed the Marquis de
Selle, "His the bravest action soldiers ever
performed!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vive les officiers Ecossais!</i>" cried the French
soldiers.  "<i>Le gentilhomme est toujours
gentilhomme</i>;" and to this day, in memory of the
Scottish valour, the place is named

<p>
"Whither awa', Clermistonlee, ye mad
buckie?" exclaimed Lord Mersington, as his friend
jostled past him under the great pillars or arcade
near the cross, one forenoon, when all the city
were abroad <i>enjoying</i> the sunshine; "whatna way
is that to gliff folk? is a dun or the deil after ye?"
</p>

<p>
"I crave pardon, my Lord, but did not observe
you; for what is all this crowd collected?"
</p>

<p>
"The heralds have been proclaiming the ratification
of the new Protestant league against Louis
of France."
</p>

<p>
"A league," added Clermistonlee scornfully,
"which our pious and glorious William hath
tinkered up, that the treasure and blood of his two
British kingdoms may be wasted in defence of the
rascally Hollanders and thick-pated Flemings.
By all the devils, my Lord, we have brought our
political pigs to a pretty market!" and he began
to whistle a cavalier air.
</p>

<p>
"Wheesht!" said Mersington, glancing furtively
around him; "this is clean contrary to the Act of
Council; and mind ye, my braw billy, if ye aye
strut with that long feather and cocked beaver,
your pinkit mantle, and lace o'erlay, like a ruffling
buck o' King Charles' time, instead o' wearing the
sad-coloured garb and sober demeanour of these
our present days, when naething but psalm-singing,
swearing in low Dutch, and mortifying the spirit,
are in vogue, you'll sune hae the eyes o' the
Council upon ye, as a Jacobite in disguise, a
hatcher o' plots, conspiracies, and the deil kens
what mair&mdash;he, he!"
</p>

<p>
"Crush me, if I will lessen one curl of my
peruke, or one slash in my doublet, to please any
Dutch king or clown that ever wore breeches!"
</p>

<p>
"You seem in a braw mood this morning.  I
warrant you'll hae pouched a round sum at
shovel-board last night in the Covenant Close."
</p>

<p>
"A messenger from the court of St. Germain
has just been arrested by Muclutchy, the macer
of Council," replied Clermistonlee, watching
keenly the sharp visage of the senator; "by Jove,
you change colour, my gossip!&mdash;any correspondence
in that quarter, hah?"
</p>

<p>
"I trow not," said the other, resuming his
immovable aspect; "d'ye tak' me for a gomeral?
What is that we see above the Tolbooth-gable?"
</p>

<p>
"The arm of the gibbet."
</p>

<p>
"Weel," rejoined the judge, drily, "and what
news brought the messenger?"
</p>

<p>
"Nought but letters from the exiled lords and
gentlemen; some of them, I tell thee, Mersington,
are deeply touching, and would harrow up even
that impenetrable heart of thine.  They tell of
blighted loves and blasted hopes, of sorrow and of
suffering, humiliation and despair; but of a loyalty
and unblemished honour that shed a glory around
the cause for which they suffer&mdash;a glory that
makes us intensely despicable by comparison.
There are passages in some of those letters from
the brave cavaliers of Dundee that have made
many of the Council almost weep with compassion.
By the Heaven that is above us, I feel that
I would be a thousand times more happy as
one of those illustrious exiles, than struggling
here to maintain, by gambling, exactions, and
roguery, a hollow rank, a gilded title, and a career
of extravagance on which I have run too far to
return!"
</p>

<p>
"The only sensible clause in your process,"
said Mersington, testily.  "But you'll hae yoursel
laid by the heels yet, and then you may whistle
on your thumb for the braw mains and revenues
of Bruntisfield and the Wrytes, for whilk you've
graned and girned these twa years and mair."
</p>

<p>
"Right! 'twas but the feeling of a moment for
the misfortunes of our former friends, whose
hearts, to their honour (unlike ours) were better
than their heads."
</p>

<p>
"Puir chields&mdash;puir chields&mdash;I doubt the Act
of eighty-nine presses unco hard on some of
them."
</p>

<p>
"Among other letters, is one from that wild
spark, Douglas of Finland, once a lieutenant in
the regiment of Dunbarton, addressed to his false
leman, Mistress Annie Laurie.  Poor credulous
fool, to trust in a woman's faith!  He knows not
that she hath become Lady Craigdarroch, and so
hath forgot him in the arms of his friend.  I like
love-letters, having written some bushels of them
in my time; but his&mdash;by the devil's beard!&mdash;it
equals anything in the <i>Banished Virgin</i>, or
<i>Cassandra</i>.  I have taken the liberty to confiscate it
to my own use; and here it is."
</p>

<p>
"Hold! a thought strikes me; the hand is
easy of imitation, and for what may ye no add a
postscriptum, whilk may be of service in your
love affair, by wedding young Fenton&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The devil confound him!"
</p>

<p>
"To some airy damoiselle; or knocking him
on the head during his French campaign?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all one.  Excellent!  Juden will deliver
it.  Annie will fly to her gossip, with every string
in her boddice straining with the greatness of her
intelligence; and as we never knew a damsel
prefer a dead lover to a living one, we may imagine
or hope the issue.  'Tis sublime!"
</p>

<p>
"I wad rather hae a dead gudewife, I ken&mdash;he,
he!" said Mersington, as he adjusted his wig and
took his friend's arm, striking his gold-headed
cane on the pavement with the air of a man who
has said something smart; "but let us hae nae
mair o' your plaguy qualms o' conscience, for
they dinna dovetail weel wi' the general tenour o'
your way.  Weel, anent this postscriptum&mdash;he,
he!&mdash;let us adjourn to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hugh Blair's, you would say.  Poor Hugh! his
locale hath changed with the times, and there
is nothing now but gloom and obscurity, cobwebs
and dust, where all was once courtly merriment
and joyous revelry.  Who could have imagined
that a time would come when this famous coffee-house
would be voted 'a den of cavalier iniquity'&mdash;that
the buirdly hosteller with whom the noble
Perth, the gallant Dunbarton, and the courtly
Dundee wiled away the hours at picquet and
tric-trac, and pushed the wine from hand to hand,
would be accused of those honours as a crime,
and thrown into the iron-room of the Tolbooth,
there to languish in poverty and misery, while the
luscious contents of his well-stored cellars were
confiscated to the public use?"
</p>

<p>
"It ill beseems ye to condemn the last clause
in your interlocutor, my noble gossip, when the
maist of the precious contents of Hughie's runlets
ran owre your ain craig.  My certie! you had a
braw rug at the forfeitures, baith gentle and
semple!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha! enough of this&mdash;the present business
is to procure the use of an inkhorn.  I am
restricted in wine to drink medicated Hippocras.
What art grinning at now?"
</p>

<p>
"Your occasional scruples o' conscience&mdash;he,
he!  Do ye mind the whilly-whaw ye were in
anent the spectre of an armed man in the hall of
Clermiston?"
</p>

<p>
"Why the devil remind me of it?" exclaimed
the other, angrily; "if it really was a spirit&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>If!</i> we have in profane as weel as sacred
writing owre mony evidences of their reality, and
their appearance for various purposes whilk we
cannot comprehend; and we have also as mony
solid proofs that the devil can mak' deid bodies
move; but anent this, see Gabrieile Nandæus in
his <i>Apology</i>, and Delrio in his <i>Disquisitiones
Magica</i>."
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;n Delrio!  Ever pestering me with thy
musty learning!&mdash;but here is a change-house,
where it may be that we can get this notable
postscriptum concocted."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The summer had passed away, and now brown
autumn was once more reddening the heather of
the Pentlands, and spreading her dun tints over
the woods of Bruntisfield; the sombre eve was
closing fast, but the bright fire burned merrily as
ever in the chamber-of-dais at the old castellated
Place, and ruddily its warm light shone through
the barred windows into the recesses of the old
woodlands, which every passing breeze robbed of
some of their crisped foliage, and strewed it over
the muirlands to the south.  The old manor-house
had recovered from the rages of that terrible
night in 1688, and was now repaired, and stronger
than ever; the windows were more thickly grated,
and numerous loopholes and two additional turrets
defended the barbican gate.
</p>

<p>
Lilian and her friend Annie were seated side
by side as of old, and opposite sat Lady Grisel&mdash;but
a change had come over them all.  Though
the hale old lady recovered from the shock of
Lilian's abduction, it had seriously affected her
health, and now she was a picture of the helplessness
of extreme old age, in her dotage, pale and
querulous, but ever gentle and childlike.  She
occupied the same old fringed chair, with its bobs
of parti-coloured silk, in which she had sat every
evening for fifty years; her ivory wheel, though
now unused, stood on one side of it, and her tall
metal-headed cane on the other.  Lilian was paler
and thinner, and had lost much of her girlish
beauty; she had many cares gnawing at her heart,
but she was still as adorable and interesting as
ever.  Annie was, if possible, more so than
formerly; the bloom of her beauty had expanded to
the utmost; her cheek had a higher colour, and
her eye a brighter sparkle; her tall and beautiful
figure was more inclined to <i>embonpoint</i>.  But alas
for poor Finland, the fickle Laurie was now the
wife of Craigdarroch, who had risen to the rank of
Colonel of Horse in the new Scottish army of
William III.  Her dress was more matronly and
magnificent than formerly, and her rich flower
tabby suit, with its brocade stomacher and silver
fringes, contrasted with Lilian's plain blue suit of
Florence silk with its falls of point d'Espagne.
</p>

<p>
Ashamed that she had broken her own solemn
engagements to her exiled lover, with the natural
fickleness of her sex, Annie was labouring to
undermine the truth of Lilian, and, Heaven knows
why, tormented the poor girl hourly, by urging
the suit of Lord Clermistonlee, and left no
arguments untried to carry her point, and remove the
scruples of her more gentle but less facile friend.
</p>

<p>
"And poor Walter!" urged Lilian, with a look
of great tenderness in her mild and moistened
eyes, replying to some observation of Annie.
</p>

<p>
"Marry come up with your Walter!&mdash;tush! bethink
you, dear Lilian, this gallant never loved
you truly, or else, dost think he would have
preferred following King James?"
</p>

<p>
Lilian's eyes sparkled; a terrible retort trembled
on her tongue, but her gentleness repressed it,
and she could only exclaim with tears&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, horror! this insinuation is the most
unkind of all.  The unmerited shame and contumely,
the dark and dishonourable suspicions that the
malice of Clermistonlee has brought upon me I
can bear, for I despise though I mourn them
deeply&mdash;but a doubt of Walter's faith&mdash;oh, Annie,
Annie, it sinks like a dagger in my heart.  'Tis
the hope of his return, animated by the same
spirit of love and truth in which he left me, that
makes me rise superior to them all.  Oh, yes!"
she exclaimed, with girlish ecstasy, "my dear,
dear Walter, the hour will yet come, when, with
a kiss of affection, I will tell thee that this old
manor and all these lands around it are thine, for
ever thine!"
</p>

<p>
"And your heart?" laughed Annie.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest, that he has already.  You see you
cannot make me angry."
</p>

<p>
"And Clermistonlee?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, name him not."
</p>

<p>
"He loves thee truly and fondly," said Annie.
</p>

<p>
"Dost think he loves me as Walter doth? dost
think he knows what love means?  Oh, no; he
never conceived it.  His passion is a turbulent
phantasy, inflamed by rivalry, difficulty, and
opposition, sharpened it may be by wounded pride
and exasperated revenge.  Oh, how can you
forget the horrid mystery that involves the fate
of his wife&mdash;the unhappy Alison Gilford?"
</p>

<p>
"Pho! she died in France."
</p>

<p>
"Of a broken heart."
</p>

<p>
"Gossip, quotha!" laughed Annie, "hearts
are never broken except in the pages of De Scuderi.
But with all his averred evil propensities, I think
there is something very noble about Lord
Clermistonlee."
</p>

<p>
"Noble?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not his wit, his elegance, and courage
excite our admiration?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;but do they make us forget that the
villain lurks under that prepossessing exterior?"
rejoined Lilian, scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Lilian, I have but one more argument
to urge, and 'tis the old one; remember that
your fair fame which his addresses have injured,
requires&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"Marriage," added Annie, quietly.  Lilian
turned pale; her spirit of dissent was too strong
for words; she shook her head with a mournful
but decided air, and, after a pause, said, "never,
oh, never!" but Annie only laughed, and a long
and unpleasant pause in the conversation ensued.
At length Lilian said, shuddering,
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what a grue came over me just now!
What can it portend?"
</p>

<p>
"That an evil spirit is near us," replied Annie,
turning pale with the superstition of the time.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, felt ye a grue, my bairn?" said Lady
Grisel, rousing momentarily from her waking
dose; "then some one is treading on the ground
that shall be your grave."  Again Lilian
shuddered, and throwing her arms around her
grand-aunt, kissed her, exclaiming,
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the first sentence I have heard you utter
for a month&mdash;and oh, what a terrible one it is!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a loud jingle at the
great risp on the barbican gate, and Elsie Elshender
hobbled in to say that an "auld broken soldier,
who had limpit up the gate was speiring for my
Lady Craigdarroch, but wadna enter."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a letter from the Laird; his troop are in
the north, watching the wild gillies of Braemar.
Tush! what can his message be now?" said Annie,
as she flew to the foot of the staircase, where a
man in a tattered red coat, a great scratch wig,
with a broad hat flapped over it, one patch on his
right eye, and another on his nose, limped forward
on a crutch, and presented a letter.  "From
whence comes it, poor man?" asked Annie.
</p>

<p>
"From the frontiers of Alsatia; blessings on
your sweet face, my noble lady," replied the
veteran, gruffly.  Annie grew pale as death.
</p>

<p>
"From whom?" she faltered.
</p>

<p>
"The brave laird of Finland, Lady Annie; on
mony a lang day's march I have trailed my pike
by his side, owre the fields o' France and the
howmes o' Holland, deil tak them baith, for there's
neither brose nor brochon, nor sowans nor sourocks
to be gotten there for love, lear, or money;
but I've far to gang this nicht, and maun een
march on, so God bless your noble ladyship&mdash;mind
a puir auld soldier that's faced fire and water
baith."
</p>

<p>
Trembling violently, Annie untied the ribbons
of her purse and gave him a carolus, which he
received with abundance of thanks, and he was
limping away when Elsie hobbled forward and
presented him with a bicker of ale.
</p>

<p>
"Drink, puir body," said she, "though the
times are sair changit, nane pass this threshold
without tasting o' the kindness o' langsyne.  We
dinna send awa' the naked and the hungry wi' a
scrap o' gospel and a screed o' a psalm, like auld
Drumdryan or the Laird o' Lickspittal owre bye
yonder; drink deep, puir body!  I once had a
son a soldier-lad, (my puir Hab that was killed in
the fearfu' times,) and, for his sake, my heart
warms to your auld red coat."
</p>

<p>
"Here's to ye, my bonny lady, and to you
Cummer Elsie, and never may ye be tarbarrelled
for a' you're sae runkled and auld; hech, how!"
and, drinking the ale to the last drop, this rough
and uncourteous old fellow tossed the bicker to
Elsie and limped away with great agility.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!" he laughed, when the barbican
gate was angrily banged behind him; "how the
gay goshawk pounced at the lure; wha would
hae thought I would ever hae hobbit and nobbit
wi' Lucky Elshender after puir Meg's mischanter
among her kale?  This carolus comes in gude
time, for my pouch is gey empty now.  Deil tak'
the patches and scratches, the rags and bags," he
continued tearing off his disguise; "again I am
Juden Stenton,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And wha daur meddle wi' me?<br />
  Wha daur meddle wi' me?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name it's Juden Stenton,<br />
  And wha daur meddle wi' me?"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And, light hearted by the success of his Lord's
scheme, he sang and laughed as he trudged back
to the city.
</p>

<p>
On rejoining Lilian, Annie was in a flutter of
extreme agitation; and, after great reluctance, in
which shame and curiosity struggled with some
remnant of her former love, and after bursting
into tears and then laughing hysterically, she
broke the seal and read in a quavering voice as
follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Trenches before Mons, penult June, 1692.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Mine own sweet Annie,
</p>

<p>
"God knoweth whether the words I am
now inditing will ever be seen by your own dear
blue eyes.  Nevertheless I write (on a drumhead
for a desk), and in great haste, for the bearer of
this starts for Versailles in an hour.  A trench
where the dead and dying lie among the blood-stained
earth, piled, yea, chin-deep, and where the
cannon-balls are rebounding every instant from
the ramparts of Mons, is a very unpleasant place
to compose love-speeches; but, believe me, that
the heart of poor Dick Douglas in suffering and
danger, poverty and exile, is still unchanged, my
beloved Annie, and as much thine as ever.  Here
are we, a company of gallant Scottish gentlemen, in
such a plight as you never could conceive; and the
very appearance of our ragged attire, our emaciated
forms and our exceeding misery, would melt
your gentle heart with the softest compassion.
My ancient signet ring, the last relic of the house
of Finland, I bartered yesterday for a loaf of
bread, and now I have nothing left save the lock
of thy hair, which shall go with me to the grave.
But more glorious by far are our Jacobite rags
than the gay bravery we might have worn under
that accursed usurper against whom we have
sworn to fight to the last gasp.
</p>

<p>
"The mischances of war are fast reducing the
faithful cavaliers of Dundee.  Starvation or the
bullet daily send some brave heart to its long
repose, and the survivors are in such a plight that
not even the Westland Whigs could wish them
lower.  From the frontiers of Spain we have
travelled to Alsatia, and from thence to Mons.  It
was a march of horrors!  We were utterly without
the necessaries of life, and in the depth of a
severe winter, marched nine hundred miles over a
country covered with snow.  Many of us were
barefooted.  For many weeks our food was nuts
in the woods, roots in the fields, horsebeans and
garlic, and thus it is that Louis XIV. rewards our
loyalty, our patience, our fatigues and achievements.
</p>

<p>
"Our old friend Walter Fenton is well.  Through
all the campaigns under Monsieur le Mareschal
Noailles and the noble Luxembourg, he hath
shewed himself worthy of the knighthood King
James' sword bestowed.  Yesterday he volunteered,
with sixty of our unhappy cavaliers, to
plant the banner of King Louis on the Bastion de
Sainte Wandree, and nobly did he redeem his
word.  Commend me to all our leal and right
honourable friends, and to those who may think
kindly of the poor cavaliers for the happy days
that have passed away for ever.  A time may
come&mdash;adieu, dearest Annie&mdash;the call to arms is
sounding along the lines, and we are about to
march for Steinkirke, a duty from which few will
return.  On my mind there weighs a heavy
presentiment of what I cannot name to thee.
Farewell, my gentle Annie, and may God bless thee!
for I fear we shall see the bonnie braes of
Maxwelton together no more.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
FINLAND,
<br />
"Late Lieut, in the Royall Scotts Ffoot."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was a tone of sorrowful resignation to a
hard and hopeless fate pervading this letter that
struck a pang of deep remorse through the heart
of Annie&mdash;but a pang for one moment only; the
volatility of her sex aided her, and smiling through
her tears, she said,
</p>

<p>
"My poor dear lighthearted Dick, would to
Heaven I could lessen the miseries you endure!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Annie," said Lilian reproachfully,
clasping her hands and weeping, "poor Walter and
poor Finland!"
</p>

<p>
"Tush!" said Annie pettishly, her dark-blue
eyes sparkling between shame and sorrow.
"Gossip, tease me not."
</p>

<p>
"Stay, there is something more&mdash;oh, read it."
</p>

<p>
"A postscriptum"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It will grieve you much to hear that Walter
Fenton hath broken his plighted troth to your
fair friend Napier, and married a French woman,
a mere camp follower, of evil repute.  Right
heavy tidings this will be for the heiress of
Bruntisfield, but I ever deemed her spark a fool; again
I kiss your hand&mdash;adieu."
</p>

<p>
The wicked expression of triumph that flashed
in Annie's eyes quickly gave way to one of
compassion and regret, on beholding the aspect of
Lilian.  Pale as death, with her eyes starting from
their sockets, her silken curls seeming to twist
like knots about her throbbing temples; her nether
lip turned from crimson to blue, and quivering
convulsively; her bosom heaving with the
terrible and sickening sensations that oppressed it.
Her little hands were firmly clenched, and her
dry hot eyes were full of fire.
</p>

<p>
"Again, again, read it once more, Annie," she
said, in a voice of strange but exquisite cadence.
</p>

<p>
"Not for worlds!" exclaimed Annie; "Oh,
thou wicked letter, thus to mar our peace and
hurl us into sorrow.  Oh, if Craigdarroch should
hear I have had a billet from my former lover,
he will kindle up into such a fit of jealousy and
rage as the world never saw; to the flames with
it!" and she tossed into the fire the letter which
poor Finland had so fondly and sorrowfully
indited.  It was consumed in a moment; and thus
all after examination of the postscript was
precluded, otherwise the forgery might have been
discovered before its effects became too fatal.
</p>

<p>
"A <i>camp follower of evil repute</i>!  It is
false&mdash;impossible&mdash;Finland hath lied!  Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;a cup
of water, for Heaven's sake&mdash;my throat is parched
and scorching!"  Lilian sank into a chair and
covered her face with her hands, but neither wept
nor swooned, for her sense of injury was too acute
for tears.
</p>

<p>
How bitter was the palsying sickness of
heart&mdash;the agony she endured!
</p>

<p>
Not a tear fell, for the fire that burned in her
breast seemed to have absorbed them.
</p>

<p>
"This is the <i>third</i> 20th of September since he
first left me.  Oh, Walter, Walter, God may forgive
thee this great ingratitude and cruelty, but I never can!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE EFFECT OF THE POSTSCRIPTUM.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"Women have died and the worms have eaten them, but not
for love."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Long, long did poor Lilian grieve and weep,
and mourn in the solitude of her gloomy home.
</p>

<p>
She endured all the complicated agony of
endeavouring to rend from her heart its dearest and
most wonted thoughts&mdash;the hopes and affection
she had fostered and cherished for years.  No
woman ever died for love but the heroine of a
romance; so Lilian of course survived it; a month
or two beheld her again tranquil and calm, though
very sorrowful and subdued in spirit, for time cures
every grief.
</p>

<p>
The bitter sentiment of insulted pride and
mortified self esteem which often come so
powerfully to the aid of the deserted, and enable them
to triumph over the more tender and acute
reflections, were kindled and fanned and fostered by
the artful sophistry of Annie, who, with her real
condolences, threw in such nice little soothing
and flattering inuendoes, mingled with condemnations
of Walter, and pretended rumours of his
marriage, the beauty and gallantries of his French
wife, whom some called a countess and others a
courtesan, that Lilian first learned to hear her
patiently and then with indignation.
</p>

<p>
With these were mingled occasional praises of
Clermistonlee, managed with great tact, for Annie
was cunning as a lynx, and never failed to flank all
her arguments with the powerful one, how necessary
it was for the restoration of her own honour,
that she should receive the roué lord as her
husband.
</p>

<p>
Poor Lilian, though these advices stung her to
the soul, learned at last to hear and to think of
them with calmness, and (shall we acknowledge
it?) to say at last, "that it might be."
</p>

<p>
With something of that fierce sentiment of
desperation and revenge which, like a gage thrown
down to fate, makes the ruined gamester place his
last stake on the turn of a card, she began deliberately
to school herself into thinking of Clermistonlee
as her future husband; and though in reality
poverty was the real cause of it, Lady Craigdarroch
failed not to impress upon Lilian how much he
was reformed, how penitent he was, and for three
years past had never been engaged in any piece of
frolic or wickedness, and wound up by asserting
that a reformed rake made the best husband.
</p>

<p>
What love and perseverance could never
accomplish, revenge achieved at last.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Alas! the love of women, it is known,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a lovely and a fearful thing;<br />
  For all of theirs upon the die is thrown<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if 'tis lost, life hath no more to bring."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Long and assiduous were the exertions, the
arguments and artifices of Annie, and long and fearful
was the struggle that tortured the heart of Lilian,
ere she would consent to receive Clermistonlee as
her suitor.
</p>

<p>
At last the fatal words were said.
</p>

<p>
Annie flew to communicate the joyous tidings,
and when next day he rode up the avenue to pay
his devoirs, the miserable girl nearly swooned.
The ring, the little embossed ring of antique gold,
the last and only gift of Walter, and which he
said contained <i>the secret</i> of his life, she had now
laid aside, carefully locked up in a cabinet, because
it brought too vividly before her the memories she
had resolved to banish from her heart for ever.
</p>

<p>
Gladly will we hurry over this chapter of pain
and humiliation.
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee had increased his great personal
advantages by all the aid of dress, and in defiance
of the sad coloured fashions of the time, wore a
voluminous Monmouth whig, the long curls of
which were puffed with aromatic powder, a suit of
rose-coloured velvet, laced so thick with gold that
the ground of the cloth was scarcely visible, a
sword and belt sparkling with jewels.  A medal
of gold, bearing his coat of arms, was suspended
by a chain of the same metal round his neck; it
was his last venture in quest of fortune, and his
lordship had resolved to spend all he possessed
upon the stake.
</p>

<p>
By the artful Annie he was led forward to the
trembling and sinking Lilian, to whom he pleaded
his cause, his constancy, and perseverance, his
raptures and agonies, his hopes and despair, with
an ardour that confused, and perhaps flattered, if
it did nothing more.  These his lordship brought
out all at a breath, as he had got the whole by
rote, having said the same things to a hundred
different women before; but now his natural
ardour and spirit of gallantry were greatly increased
by the touching character which sorrow, vexation,
and disappointment had imparted to the soft
beauty of Lilian&mdash;and also by the aspect of the
comfortable old manor house and the acres of fine
arable land that lay around it; while she (shall
we confess it?), as bitter thoughts of Walter and
his French wife rose up within her, stole glances
from time to time at her noble and courtly
suitor&mdash;glances which he soon perceived, and fired with
new animation, threw such an air of devotion into
his addresses that he&mdash;triumphed.
</p>

<p>
Annie placed the hand of Lilian within that of
Clermistonlee; he pressed her to his heart, and
she did not withdraw it; but burst into a passion
of tears.  He then threw his splendid chain, with
its medal, around her bending neck, and pressed
her to his breast, and so sudden was the revulsion
of feeling that Lilian fainted.
</p>

<p>
An hour afterwards Clermistonlee, with all his
embroidery glittering in the sun, was seen
galloping back to the city like a madman; he dashed
through the Portsburgh, and reined up near the
Bowfoot, where, at the summit of a ten-storied
edifice, dwelt Mr. Ichabod Bummel, minister of
the Gospel.
</p>

<p>
"The father of confusion take your long stair!
Why, Mr. Bummel, 'tis like a rascally old steeple,"
said the lord, breaking breathlessly in upon the
lank-haired and long-visaged pastor, who was
intent upon "The Hind let loose" of Alexander
Sheills.
</p>

<p>
"Yea, a tower of Babel&mdash;but what hath procured
me the honour of your lordship's visit?"
</p>

<p>
"By all the devils, don't think I am come to
drub thee for that lecture on the cutty stool&mdash;ha,
ha!  I am about to be married, man&mdash;and want
you to proclaim the banns and so forth&mdash;but my
Lord Mersington will see after them for me."
</p>

<p>
"As my <i>Bombshell</i> saith, marriage is an
honourable and godly estate&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But a deuced poor one, sometimes, Mr. Ichabod.
I am about to be married to Lilian, of Bruntisfield,
and thou shalt espouse us, because the
citizens hold thee to be their first preacher, and
it will increase my influence among them."
</p>

<p>
"But, my Lord," began Mr. Ichabod, bowing.
</p>

<p>
"<i>But</i> me nothing&mdash;'tis my non-attendance at
kirk and my old tricks you aim at&mdash;pho!  I am a
thorough Reformado&mdash;but, Mr. Ichabod, hast
never a drop of wine about thee?&mdash;'tis a hot
forenoon."
</p>

<p>
"My dwelling contains nothing but water, and
it is a plack the runlet in these dear years; but,
my Lord," continued the divine, after sundry gasps
and contortions of visage, "if I lend all my
influence to render popular this intended espousal,
whilk I perceive to be the main object of your
visit, may I crave your Lordship's favour in
another particular?"
</p>

<p>
"Command me in all things save my purse,
for 'tis a mere vacuum, if thy philosophy will
admit of such a thing.  Say forth, my Apostle!"
</p>

<p>
"I love the maiden called Meinie Elshender&mdash;yea,
I love her powerfully with the carnal love of
this world, and the maiden is not altogether
indisposed to view me favourably."
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!" said Clermistonlee, while the minister
looked complacently down on his long spindle
shanks; "in the name of mischief, who is Meinie
Elshender?"
</p>

<p>
"Handmaiden to the young Madam Lilian,
who views me as an abomination&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By all the devils, thou shalt have her, <i>bongré,
malgré</i>, and after I am fairly wedded, the best
kirk in the Lothians to boot&mdash;even should I make
Juden shoot the present incumbent."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven reward these generous promises,"
replied Ichabod, with a smile of incredulity.
"Well it is that the maiden hath escaped the
snares of her first lover, who was a soldier of
Antichrist&mdash;a musqueteer of the bluidy Dunbarton."
</p>

<p>
"Say rather the most princely earl of the noble
house of Douglas!  Ha, ha&mdash;by my faith! we
whigs are winning the false lemans of the
cavaliers in glorious style."
</p>

<p>
"And now, my lord, I have one other boon to
crave," said Ichabod, producing a tattered and
dog-eared MS. from a bunker.  "This is a book
of which doubtless your Lordship hath heard; my
<i>Bombshell aimet at the taile of the Great Beast</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the devil take thy bombshell&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shame, my lord.  It proveth that Jonah&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Swallowed the whale; eh, Master Ichabod?"
said the gay lord, pirouetting about and laughing
boisterously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my Lord, for a centiloquy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha! a what?"
</p>

<p>
"A hundredfold discourse, to convince thee of
the crime of this irreverence and irreligion."
</p>

<p>
"I crave pardon, but what do you want, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Your Lordship's subscription; 'tis to be
published in the imprinting press in the Parliament
Close, whenever new irons are brought over from
Holland."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by all the devils, certainly; send me a
dozen of copies.  Faith!  I must be quite pious
henceforth.  And now, bravo! see the Kirk Session
about my little affairs, while I ride down the
Lawnmarket to old Gideon Grasper, the Clerk to
the Signet, for there will be a mountain of papers
to sign and seal, and so forth; but the banns, the
banns, next Sunday, remember;" and chaunting,
"With a hey lillelu and a how lo lan," his
lordship danced away out, tripping down the long stair
by three steps at a time, and mounting, galloped
into the upper part of the city.

CHAPTER XVI.

THE BATTLE OF STEINKIRKE.

<p class="poem">
  As torrents roll increased by numerous rills,<br />
  With rage impetuous down their echoing hills;<br />
  Rush to the vales and pour'd along the plain,<br />
  Roar through a thousand channels to the main;<br />
  The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound:<br />
  So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ILIAD, BOOK IV.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was the night before the famous battle of
Steinkirke, when the confederates under
William III. encountered the gallant and brilliant
army of the great François Henri Duc de Luxembourg.
</p>

<p>
In happy ignorance of what was being acted at
home by those whose memory lay so near their
hearts, Walter Fenton and Douglas of Finland
were carousing with their brothers in war and
misfortune around a blazing fire, composed of
rafters borrowed for the purpose from the roof of
a neighbouring Flemish house.
</p>

<p>
Intent on crushing the alarming confederation
of the Protestant powers against him, Louis XIV. had
taken the field in person at the head of 120,000
men.  This sensual, selfish, and weak-minded
monarch was accompanied by all the effeminate
pomp and tinsel splendour of an eastern emperor;
his women and paramours, numerous enough for
a seraglio; his dancers, players, musicians; his
kitchen, opera, household, and all the ministers of
his luxury, his pleasures, and his tyranny, in
themselves a host, crowded and encumbered the
great camp of his splendid army, which, however,
soon captured Namur, a strong city on the Meuse,
though strengthened by all the skill of the great
Coehorn, and defended by the valour of the Prince
de Brabazon and 9,000 chosen soldiers.
</p>

<p>
King William, whose duty it was to have raised
the siege of this important fortress, lay with
100,000 men within gunshot of Louis, but, embued
with all the stolid and phlegmatic stupidity of a
Hollander, permitted the place to be captured, by
which his military reputation was as much injured
as that of Louis was increased.  The victor of
Namur immediately returned to Versailles,
surrounded by triumph and adulation, worshipped
undeservedly as a hero, and extolled as a
conqueror, while William, whose inertness had at last
given way to necessary activity, excited by shame
and exasperation, having reviewed on the plain of
Genappe a fresh quota of ten battalions of
Scottish infantry, pushed forward against Mareschal
Luxembourg, intent on retrieving his honour.
</p>

<p>
After basely employing a spy named Millevoix,
under pain of torture and death, to mislead the
French commander by false intelligence of the
confederates' movements, William advanced with
his 100,000 bayonets to prevent him from taking
up a position between the then obscure villages of
Steinkirke and Enghien, a royal barony of the
house of Bourbon.  With his usual bad generalship
William completely failed, for Luxembourg
outflanked him, gained the position, and trusting
to the communications of the perfidious (or
unfortunate) Millevoix, not anticipating any attack,
confined himself to his tent, as he laboured under
severe indisposition.
</p>

<p>
Not expecting an <i>alerte</i>, the whole of his
numerous and brilliant army lay intrenched among
the fertile fields and pastures of the Flemings, whose
thick hedges, solid walls, and comfortable houses,
were cut down, torn up and overthrown without
ceremony to render the position more secure.
</p>

<p>
The post occupied by the Scottish officers was
near the Senne, a slow and sluggish river.  The
sun had set, and far over the long perspective of
the level landscape, that in some parts withdrew
to the extreme horizon, shone the red departing
flush of the last evening many would behold on
earth.  In some places the river was reddened by
the gleam of the distant fires, whose flickering
chain marked out the camp of Luxembourg; the
higher eminences were covered by woods and
orchards, from which the evening wind came laden
with the rich perfume of the summer blossom.
Save the hum of the extended camp all was still
round Steinkirke, and where the exiled cavaliers
were bivouacked there was little more heard than
the monotonous ripple of the Senne, as it flowed
past its willow shaded banks on its way to the
northern sea.
</p>

<p>
The Scottish exiles were always more merry
than usual on the eve of a battle, for it freed many
from a life of humiliation and hardship, to which
they deemed an honourable death a thousand times
preferable.  At times an expression of stern joy,
of ghastly merriment, at others of deep abstraction
pervaded the little group, as they clustered round
the fire that blazed in a little alcove formed by an
orchard on the river side.  There their arms were
piled, and they rolled from hand to hand a keg of
Hollands, to which they had helped themselves at
the devastation of the Flandrian château de Senne.
Afar off, above the village spire of Steinkirke, the
silver moon rose broadly and resplendently to
light the wide and fertile landscape with its glory.
The Senne and Tender brightened like two floods
of flowing crystal, and the willows that drooped
over them seemed the work of magic, as their
dewy leaves glittered in the rays of the summer
moon.
</p>

<p>
The stern hearts of that melancholy band were
soothed by the beauty of the scenery, the seclusion
of their tentless bivouac, the softness of the
Flemish moonlight, and a song that Finland sang
completed the effect of the place and time.  He
reclined upon his knapsack, and his fine features,
which long privation and toil had sharpened and
attenuated, flushed and reddened as he sang of his
love that was far away, and felt his brave heart
expand with the dear and long cherished hopes
and memories her image stirred within it.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Maxweltoun Braes are bonnie,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where early fa's the dew;<br />
  And blue-eyed Annie Laurie<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave me her promise true.<br />
  Gave me her promise true,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never forgot shall be;<br />
  And for my bonnie Annie Laurie,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would lay me down and dee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Her locks are like the sunshine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her breast is like the swan;<br />
  Her hand is like the snawdrift,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mine her waist micht span.<br />
  But oh! that promise true!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will ne'er be forgot by me,<br />
  And for my blue-eyed Annie Laurie,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would lay me down and dee!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This famous song, which, with its beautiful air,
is so chaste and pleasing, and still so much
admired in Scotland, poor Finland in his chivalric
spirit had composed, to lighten the toil of many a
long and arduous march, and now, inspired by the
love and the fond recollections that trembled in
his heart, he slowly sang the last verse with great
tenderness and pathos.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Like dew on the gowan lying,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the fa' of her fairy feet;<br />
  And like wind in summer sighing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice is low and sweet.<br />
  But O that promise true!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes her all the world to me;<br />
  And for my bonnie Annie Laurie,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd lay me down and dee."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Every word seemed to come from his overcharged
heart, and as he sang the beautiful melody
silence and sadness stole over the listening group.
Softened by the dialect and the music of their
fatherland, every heart was melted and every eye
grew moist; the red camp fires and the shining
waters of the Senne, the white tents of Luxembourg,
the woodlands and orchards of Steinkirke
passed away, and Scotland's hoary hills and pathless
vallies rose before them, for their eyes and
hearts were in the land from which they were
expatriated for ever.
</p>

<p>
It was the morning of the 24th of July, and in
unclouded splendour the sun shone from the far
horizon upon the tented camp of Luxembourg, on
the standards waving and arms glittering within
the rudely and hastily constructed entrenchments
of the great and veteran engineer the Chevalier
Antoine de Ville.  Like bright snowy clouds the
morning vapour curled upwards from the sedges
of the Senne, and the dewy foliage of the woods,
and rolling lazily along the plain, shrouded
everything in a thick and gause-like veil of white
obscurity, which the rays of the sun edged with
the hue of gold.  Under cover of this, although
the French knew it not, the entire force of the
allied nations, led by William of England, were
coming rapidly on in two dense columns, intent
on avenging the disgraces they had endured at
Namur.  Luxembourg lay within his bannered
pavilion on a bed of sickness, and neither he nor
his soldiers were aware of the foe's approach until
the Prince of Wirtemburg, at the head of ten
battalions of English, Dutch, and Danes, drove
back his outposts on the right, making a furious
attack on the camp, which instantly became a
scene of greater confusion than King Agramont's.
</p>

<p>
The patter of the musquetry, the roll of the
advancing drums, and the bullets whistling through
his tent, roused the brave Mareschal, who, leaping
from his camp-bed, forgot his illness in the ardour
and tumult of the moment.  Hastily his pages
attired and armed him, and throwing his magnificent
surcoat above his gilded corslet, he seized
his sword and baton, and rushed forth to repair what
the artifices of William, the treachery of Millevoix,
and the bravery of Wirtemburg had already
achieved.  To muster, to rally his immense force
and repel the Prince of Wirtemburg, were but
the work of a few seconds, and the great leader,
who five minutes before had lain inert on a couch
of illness, was now spurring his caparisoned horse
from column to column, with his plumes waving,
his accoutrements glittering, and his baton
brandished aloft; his features filled with animation,
his soul with energy.
</p>

<p>
The Dukes of Bourbon and Vendome, the
Princes of Turenne and Conté, the Duc de Chartres,
a youth of fifteen, whose almost girlish beauty
made him the sport and the idol of the army, the
Marquis de Bellefonde, and several thousand
chevaliers of noble birth and matchless spirit, by their
presence, their ardour, and example, restored
perfect order, and in admirable battle array they
stood prepared to encounter the host of the
Protestant confederation.
</p>

<p>
As the sun rose higher the mist which shrouded
the whole plain around the village of Steinkirke
was gradually exhaled upwards, and as it rolled
away the entire army of William III., a hundred
thousand strong, were seen in order of battle,
advancing as rapidly as the numerous thorn
hedges, ditches, and dykes, which intersected the
yellow cornfields, would permit.
</p>

<p>
In defence of a place which it was expected
William's brilliant cavalry would assail, the
Scottish officers were posted in an abbatis of
apple-trees that had been cut down by the pioneers,
and made an intricate breastwork all round; and
within it, with their arms loaded, they stood in
close order, watching with lowering brows and
kindling eyes the scarlet ranks of their countrymen,
to whom they now&mdash;for the first time since
their exile&mdash;found themselves opposed in battle.
</p>

<p>
The golden bloom of the ripe and waving
corn-fields, through which the lines were advancing
in triple ranks, with their serried arms and
embroidered standards glittering, threw forward the
bright scarlet costume in strong relief, and the
hearts of the little band of exiles beat with
increased excitement as the moment of a general
encounter drew nigh.
</p>

<p>
"Behold yonder fellows in our uniform!"
exclaimed one, as the Scottish infantry debouched
in heavy column on the French left, with their
twenty standards displayed, and their drums
loading the air with the old march of the
Covenanters.
</p>

<p>
"God knoweth the sorrow, the bitterness, the
hatred, and the fierce exultation that swell my
heart by turns in this auspicious hour!" said
Finland, striking his breast.
</p>

<p>
"You speak my very thoughts," responded
Walter, with a deep sigh; "yonder are the old
Royals, but now another than Dunbarton wields
his baton over them; yonder are the standards
we have carried&mdash;but others bear them now.
How hard to forget that these are our countrymen!
Do not ourselves seem to be marching
against us?"
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this, gentlemen," said the veteran
Laird of Dunlugais.  "In them I behold only the
rebels of our king, and the sycophants of an
usurper.  This day let us remember only that we are
fighting under the standard of the first captain of
the age, and about to win fresh glories for the
most magnificent prince that ever occupied the
throne of France!"
</p>

<p>
The battle was begun by Hugh Mackay, of Scoury.
</p>

<p>
Led by that brave and veteran general, a dense
column of British cavalry, accoutred in
voluminous red coats, great Dutch hats, looped up,
and vast boots of black leather, with slung
musquets and brandished swords, rushed at full gallop
to the charge on one flank, while the Prince of
Wirtemburg assailed the other.
</p>

<p>
The abbatis lay full in front of Mackay, who
held aloft his long gilt baton, as he led on this
heavy mass of troopers.  On they came, horse to
horse, and boot to boot like a moving mountain;
but the deadly and deliberate volley poured upon
them by the Scottish cavaliers threw them into
immediate confusion; the front squadrons by
becoming entangled among their falling horses and
riders, recoiled suddenly on the rear, who were
still spurring forward; the furious shock produced
an immediate and irredeemable confusion, and
the whole gave way ere another volley of that
leaden rain was poured upon their dense array.
</p>

<p>
The roar of forty thousand musquets now
burst like thunder on the ear, as the Prince de
Conté and the brave De Chartres, the boy-soldier,
at the head of the superb household infantry,
assailed the British, and volleying in platoons,
continued to press upon them with increasing
ardour until within pike's length of each other,
when Conté led the whole to the charge.  The
shock was irresistible!  Count Solmes failed to
support the English and Scots, who immediately
gave way, and a tremendous slaughter was made,
especially among the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Les Ecossais, retreat!" exclaimed Conté.
"'Tis a miracle.  Tête Dieu! 'tis surely a bad
cause, when the hand of Heaven is against them!"
</p>

<p>
The Scottish regiments of Coutts, Mackay,
Angus, Grahame, and Leven, were cut to pieces,
and the English Guards nearly shared the same
fate.  James Earl of Angus, a brave youth in his
twenty-first year, was shot dead at the head of
his Cameronians, William Stuart Viscount of
Montjoy, Sir Robert Douglas, Lieutenant-General
James Douglas, Sir John Lanier, Colonel Lauder,
and many other brave Scottish gentlemen were
slain, while the Prince de Conté bore all before
him.
</p>

<p>
With the gallant Prince of Wirtemburg it fared
otherwise.  Pressing onward at the head of his
English, he carried off some of the French
artillery, and after immense slaughter, stormed the
intrenchment which covered their position, but
finding himself in danger of being overpowered,
he twice sent his aide-de-camp to crave succour
from the phlegmatic William and from Count
Solmes, a noble of the House of Nassau.  Twice
over a field that was strewn with thousands of
dead and dying, and swept by the fire of so many
thousand musquets, cannon, and coehorns, the
brave aide spurred his horse to beg succour for
the prince his master; but William neglected,
and the Dutch noble derided his request.
</p>

<p>
"Vivat Wirtemburg!" cried Solmes, laughing;
"let us see what sport his English bulldogs will
make."
</p>

<p>
At length William shook off the inertness that
seemed to possess his faculties amid the storm of
war that raged around him, and in person ordered
Solmes to sustain the advance of the left wing
which Wirtemburg had led on so successfully.
Thus urged, the unwilling Lord of Brunsveldt,
made an unavailing movement with his cavalry,
but left a few English and Danes to sustain the
whole brunt of the battle.
</p>

<p>
Amid the dense smoke that rolled in white
clouds and concealed the adverse lines, their
carnage and its horrors, again and again the brave
old Laird of Scoury led his squadrons to the
charge, resolved to force the passage to turn the
flank of Luxembourg or die, and again they were
repulsed from the abbatis by the courage of the
desperate Cavaliers.  As yet, not one trooper had
penetrated among them, though hundreds and
their horses lay groaning and rolling in the
agonies of death, entangled among the apple-laden
branches of the prostrate trees, grasping and
rending them with their teeth in the tortures of
dissolution.  As yet not one of the Scottish exiles
had fallen; but now Mackay ordered a body of
his dragoons to dismount, to unsling their short
fusees, and from behind the piles of dead and
dying men and chargers, to fire upon the abbatis
which could afford no protection against bullets.
</p>

<p>
A furious fusilade now ensued, and Fenton
soon missed Finland from his side; he turned,
and his hot blood cooled for a moment to behold
him lying on the bloody turf in the last agonies
of death.  A ball had pierced his breast; his
eyes were glazing, and he was beating the earth
with his heels, as he blew from his quivering lips
the bells of blood and foam.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunate Douglas!
</p>

<p>
Something was clenched in his hand and
pressed to his lips; but as his dying energies
relaxed, and his brave spirit fled to heaven, the
relic fell on the turf;&mdash;it was Annie Laurie's
braid of bright brown hair.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, dear Finland," exclaimed Walter,
kissing the dead man's hand.  "Here end thy
love and misfortunes together!"  Sorrow, rage,
and ardour roused the fury of Fenton to the
utmost, and with his clubbed weapon he sprang
over the trees of the abbatis, exclaiming, "to the
charge, gentlemen Scots!&mdash;to the charge!  Never
let it be said that the Cavaliers of Dundee played
at long bowles with those false English churls.
Victory and revenge!"
</p>

<p>
Fired by his example, and animated by national
and political hatred against those who had
deserted James VII., and wrought so many miseries
to his few adherents, the little band sprang from
the abbatis and threw themselves with incredible
fury and determination on the dismounted
troopers.  Onward they pressed over piles of
dead and wounded, while every instant the balls
that flew thick as drifting rain, thinned their
narrow ranks, and added many another item
to the vast amount of that day's carnage.
</p>

<p>
None can be so brave as those for whom life
has lost every charm; and none so reckless as
those who have a thousand real or imaginary
wrongs to avenge.  Thus, heedless alike of the
number of their antagonists, who were again
pressing up to the attack, the Scottish Cavaliers
came on pell mell, and a desperate conflict ensued
with firelocks and fusils clubbed.
</p>

<p>
As Walter, forgetful of everything else but to
glut a fierce spirit of revenge, pressed onward, he
encountered a tall and powerful officer.  The
nobility of his aspect and the richness of his
attire (for his scarlet coat was so richly interlaced
with bars of gold as to be almost sword-proof) not
less than the vigour with which he kept his soldiers
to their duty, made him a marked man; but Walter
struck him from his horse and flourished the butt
of his musket over him.
</p>

<p>
"Take these, you tattered villain," said the
officer, offering a splendid watch and ring; "take
these and spare my life."
</p>

<p>
"Insult me not, Sir," exclaimed Walter Fenton
with undisguised scorn.  "I am one of the officers
of Viscount Dundee&mdash;of Dundee the brave and
loyal."
</p>

<p>
"The vilest minion of hell and tyranny that
ever disgraced his country&mdash;then doubly are you
traitor!" said the other starting from the ground
and flashing a pistol in Walter's face.  Blinded by
fury and the smoke of the discharge, he drove
his bayonet through the breast of the officer and
fairly pinned him to the turf.
</p>

<p>
"Curse on the hour that I die by the hand of a
base and renegade clown like thee!" exclaimed
the dying man, half choked in his welling blood.
</p>

<p>
"Traitor!" cried his destroyer furiously; "you
die by the hand of Sir Walter Fenton, Knight
Banneret of Scotland!"
</p>

<p>
"So falls Hugh Mackay, of Scoury!" moaned
the other as he sank backward and expired.
</p>

<p>
"Scoury!" reiterated Walter; "hah! then this
hour avenges Dundee the slaughter of
Killycrankie and of Cromdale."
</p>

<p>
At that moment he was hurled to the earth by
a wounded charger as it rushed madly from the
conflict.  He fell against a tree and lay stunned
and insensible to all that passed around him.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting, and still the doubtful
battle continued to be waged with undiminished
ardour, until Mareschal Boufflers, at the head of a
powerful body of cavalry, the French and Scottish
gendarmerie, and the royal regiment, De Rousillon,
swept like a torrent over the corpse-strewn plains
with the oriflamme, displayed and decided the
fortune of the war just as the sun's broad disc
dipped behind the far horizon.  William, instead
of restoring his tarnished honour, was compelled
to retreat in renewed disgrace, leaving many
officers of valour and distinction and 3,000 soldiers
slain; while the French, though they had to regret
the fall of an equal number, with the Prince de
Turenne, the Marquis de Bellefonde, Tilladete,
Fernaçon, and many other chevaliers of noble
blood, remained masters of the field, over which
they suspended from a lofty gibbet King William's
luckless confidant, the spy and intriguer Millevoix.
</p>

<p>
Paris resounded with joy and acclamation on
tidings of this great victory arriving; the princes
and soldiers who had served there were idolized
as superior beings by the ladies and women of
every rank, whose transports amounted to a species
of frenzy, and from that hour for many a year
every ornament and piece of dress was known by
the name of <i>Steinkirke</i>.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
A DISCLOSURE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>'Tis night</i>;&mdash;and glittering o'er the trampled heath,<br />
  Pale gleams the moonlight on the field of death;<br />
  Lights up each well-known spot, where late in blood,<br />
  The vanquished yielded, and the victor stood;<br />
  When red in clouds the sun of battle rode,<br />
  And poured on Britain's front its favoring flood.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD GRENVILLE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Again the summer moon rose brightly over
the secluded village of Steinkirke, and poured its
cold and steady lustre on cornfields drenched in
blood, and trod to gory mire by the charge of the
spurred squadrons, the closer movements of the
compact squares of infantry, or the artillery's
track; on the pale and upturned faces of the
dying, the distorted and ghastlier lineaments of
the dead,&mdash;on a wide battle-field strewn with all
the trophies of war and destruction,&mdash;misery and
agony.
</p>

<p>
Save where illumined by the gleams of moonlight,
by the red flashes of a few distant fire-arms,
and the redder glare from a convent burned by
the retreating British, the ruddy conflagration of
which mingled with the last faint glow of the
departed sun, the field seemed gloomy and dark.
A narrow lurid streak at the distant horizon
shewed where the sun had set.  The roar of that
great battle had now died away, but it had sent
forth an echo over France and Britain denoting
joy to one and sorrow to the other.  Where,
then, was William of Orange, and where his
mighty host?
</p>

<p>
The contest was now over, and, save the distant
popping of a few skirmishers or plunderers, every
sound of strife had ceased; but the cool night
wind was laden with a sad and wailing murmur, a
sound which it is seldom the lot of man to
hear&mdash;the mingled moans of many thousands of men
enduring all the complicated torture of sabre and
gunshot wounds and the most excruciating thirst.
Many a solemn prayer and pious ejaculation of
deep contrition, uttered in many a varied tongue,
were then ascending from that moonlit battlefield
to the throne of God, while others in
their ravings called only on Death to ease
them of their torments; and long ere sunrise
the stern king of terrors attended the summons
of many.
</p>

<p>
A great cannon royal, drawn by eight horses
and escorted by the artillerists of the Brigade de
Dauphine, passed near the corpse-heaped abbatis
where Walter Fenton lay, and he implored them
to remove him from the field.  They were passing
him unheeded, when one exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
"<i>Il est un officier Ecossais!</i>" upon which the
drivers reined up: the soldiers sprang from the
tumbril, and placing him beside them, galloped
across the field of battle towards the redoubts on
the left of Luxembourg's position.  The jolting
occasioned Walter exquisite agony, and he could
not repress a shudder when the cannon wheels
passed over the crackling body of some dead or
wounded soldier who lay prostrate in their path.
</p>

<p>
After riding a mile or two he fell from his seat
with violence, and once more became insensible.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Il est morte</i>" said the Frenchmen, as they
whipped up their horses and thought no more
about him.
</p>

<p>
After lying long in a dreamy state, tormented
by a burning thirst and feeling prickly and
shooting pains over his whole body as the blood
flowed back into its old channels, Walter made an
attempt to rise, but the motion occasioned him
exquisite pain, and the whole landscape swam around
him.  He thought he was mortally wounded; a
cold perspiration burst over his temples; a stupor
again stole upon his senses, and, believing he was
dying, he piously recommended himself to God,
closed his eyes, and lay down resigned to his
fate.
</p>

<p>
But the mind was active though the frame
remained inert, and he thought of Lilian, of
Finland and Annie, and how the hand of Death
had thrown a cold blight over all their fondest
hopes and prospects, and so weak had he become
that audible sobs burst from him.
</p>

<p>
The heavy dew was falling fast, and its moisture
refreshed him; he raised his head, and near him
saw the figure of a female in a sombre and
peculiar garb: she was completely attired in
black; a thick veil of the same colour with a
little hood of white linen were drawn closely
round her face, which seemed pale and colourless
as that of death in the uncertain rays of a
cruise which she carried; but though aged, she
was marked by a serenity and air of repose
singularly winning and prepossessing.  She bent
tenderly over him with a face expressive of the
deepest commiseration.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a vision!" was Walter's first thought;
"'tis an Ursuline nun," was his second.
</p>

<p>
"Poor youth&mdash;unhappy youth!" said the
stranger tenderly, and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven's blessing on you, gentle lady,"
said Walter, as he endeavoured to rise; "no tears
can be more precious in the sight of Heaven than
those shed by compassion.  God save great
Luxembourg!  We have this day gained a
glorious victory; but at what a price to me!" he
continued in his own language.  "Alake! my
brave and noble friends, the best blood of
Scotland has mingled yonder with the waters of
the Senne."
</p>

<p>
"Scotland!" replied the venerable Ursuline,
and her mild eyes became filled with animation
and sadness.  "I acknowledge with sorrow and
pride that your country is also mine; but,
alas! I can only remember it with horror and
humiliation.  Your voice takes me back to the pleasant
days of other and happier years, and stirs an echo
in the deepest recesses of my heart.  Oh, my
God! what is this that I feel within me?  Intercede for
me blessed Ursula, and save me from my own
thoughts!  Oh, let not the contentment in which
I have dwelt these many years be disturbed by
worldly regrets and old unhappiness!"
</p>

<p>
There was a deep pathos in her voice, an air of
subdued sorrow, mildness, and melancholy in her
features, and a soft expression in her eye that was
very winning, and Walter kissed her hand with
a sentiment of affection and respect, and, strange
to say, she did not withdraw it.
</p>

<p>
"I belonged to the convent of Ursulines at
Steinkirke.  At vesper-time the Count Solmes
sacked it with his troopers; (God forgive him and
them the sacrilege!) they expelled us with savage
violence, and I found shelter in a cottage close by.
Your groans drew me forth.  Permit me to lead
you, my poor son, for indeed you seem very weak.
There is one poor fugitive there already, a
countrywoman of our own, to whom I hope you will
bring pleasant tidings; let us go."
</p>

<p>
They entered the humble Flemish cottage, the
wide kitchen of which was brilliantly illuminated
by a blazing fire of turf, that lit the furthest
recesses of the great but rude apartment, that
strongly resembled those represented by
Rembrandt and Teniers, where every imaginable
implement and article, garden and household utensil,
hang from the beams of the open roof, load the
walls, or encumber every available nook and
corner; a heavy Flemish boor, in voluminous
brown breeches, arose and doffed his fur cap, and
with his wife made way for the sister of St. Ursula,
who led Walter to a seat.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully he drained to the last drop a pewter
flaggon of water that the housewife gave him, and
was about to speak, when his attention was
arrested by the sudden appearance of a young lady.
She was very beautiful, and had an exquisitely fair
complexion, the natural paleness of which grief
and fear had very much increased; her blue eyes
sparkled with animation, and her half dishevelled
hair was of the brightest and glossiest but palest
flaxen.  Running to Walter Fenton she took both
his hands in hers, and said, with a touching
earnestness of manner,
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Sir! come you from the field of battle?"
</p>

<p>
"This moment, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are Scottish by your voice, but alas! you
wear the garb of Louis."
</p>

<p>
"My dear madam, it is the garb of loyalty and
exile; of great suffering, and of much endurance."
</p>

<p>
"Unhappy Sir, you are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One of the cavaliers of Dundee."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, tell me if you know aught of the fate of
General Mackay in this day's carnage; Mackay,
the Laird of Scoury?" she added a little proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Lady," faltered Walter, quite overcome by
the question and the aspect of the speaker, "the
brave champion of Presbyterianism is no more.
I&mdash;I saw him slain."
</p>

<p>
"My father! oh, my father!" cried Margaret
Mackay, in a voice that pierced the conscience-stricken
Fenton to the heart; "I shall never see
thee more&mdash;never behold thy kind old face and
silver hair.  Oh, my God!  I am quite alone in
the world, and what will become of me now?  Oh,
Lady Clermistonlee!" she exclaimed, and pressing
against her heart the hand of the nun, sank into a
chair and swooned.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Clermistonlee!</i>" reiterated Walter, starting;
but the helpless condition of his young
countrywoman demanded immediate attention, and he
was compelled to smother his curiosity for a time,
until she had partially recovered, and then the
good Ursuline, after attending her with the most
motherly care, left her engaged in prayer in another
apartment, and turned all her attention to the
wound on Walter's head.
</p>

<p>
With an adroit neatness of hand, a soft
insinuating manner which drew the heart of Walter
towards her as to a mother, the compassionate nun,
assisted by the silent Flemish housewife, bathed
the wound, cut away the long clotted locks, and
bound it up, while the round visaged boor, whose
mind was wholly absorbed by the loss of a field of
corn, which had been cut down by Boufflers'
foraging dragoons, sat with his eyes intently fixed
on the smoke that curled from his pipe.
</p>

<p>
Walter had been so little accustomed to
kindness, that all the strong feelings of his warm
heart now gushed forth.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand thanks, dear madam!" he
exclaimed.  "I know not whether it is your
kindness, the mere ardour of my heart, or some
mysterious influence that Heaven alone can see,
which calls forth all my fondest and most
reverential sentiments towards you."
</p>

<p>
The Ursuline smiled sadly, and retired a pace.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what is this new feeling that stirs within
me?" continued Walter, in a half musing voice.
"It seems as if your face bore the long remembered
features of some kind friend or dear relative.
Like a gleam of sunshine through a mist, they
come back to me from the obscurity of the past
like those of one whom&mdash;but, ah! whither is my
enthusiasm carrying me?  Dear madam, once
more a thousand thanks, for now I must leave,
and shall never see you more, but your kindness
will ever be remembered by Walter Fenton with
gratitude and love."
</p>

<p>
"Fenton!" said the Ursuline, putting back his
hair, and tenderly surveying his emaciated
features, "I once had a dear though humble friend
of that name, and my heart yearns to thee for her
sake.  But wherefore this hurry to depart?  Your
wound?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know not where I am, lady, and should any
of the Statholder's people come this way I should
assuredly be shot."
</p>

<p>
"Then, in the name of all that is blessed, away!
The fires of the French camp are still visible, and
you may gain it ere daybreak."
</p>

<p>
This passed in French, but the boor understood
it; his eyes twinkled, and knocking the ashes from
his pipe he slowly stuck it in his leathern cap and
stole out unperceived.
</p>

<p>
"And what will be the fate of this poor daughter
of the brave Mackay, for everywhere the French
are swarming around us?"
</p>

<p>
"Through a lady of the house of Nassau, who
belongs to our now, alas! ruined convent, I will
see her consigned to the care of her father's best
friend, William of Orange."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis fortunate.  It reminds me of what I
scarcely dare to ask.  She called you by the name
of my bitterest enemy&mdash;Clermistonlee," said
Walter, biting his lip; "Clermistonlee, who has been
my rival and the bane of my existence.  Oh,
madam, what terrible mystery is concealed under
this Ursuline habit!"
</p>

<p>
As Walter spoke the blood came and went in
the faded face of the trembling recluse.  One
moment, when fired by animation, her features
seemed almost beautiful, and the next they were
withered, rigid, and aged.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Fenton," faltered the nun&mdash;"Mr. Fenton,
for so I presume you are named?"
</p>

<p>
"I am Sir Walter Fenton, lady, by the King's
grace."
</p>

<p>
The nun bowed slightly.
</p>

<p>
"My heart warms, Sir Walter, to that dear
native land which I shall never behold again, and
in a moment of such weakness I revealed myself
to that poor fugitive girl, whom fate so happily
threw under my protection, when the confederates
were defeated and dispersed&mdash;&mdash;.  You know him
then, this wicked man, to whom fate in an evil
hour gave me as a wife.  Oh, Randal!  Randal!
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.  Let me not recall in bitterness the
burning thoughts of years long passed and
gone&mdash;thoughts which I have long since learned to
suppress, or endure with calmness and resignation."
</p>

<p>
"Enough, dear madam, I am animated by no
vulgar curiosity, and time presses.  Oh, learn
rather to forget your earlier griefs than to
remember them.  Too well do I know the Lord
Clermistonlee, and can easily conceive a long and
painful history of domestic woe and suffering.
You are the unfortunate Alison Gilford?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the house of Gilford of that ilk in Lothian,"
continued the recluse with tearless composure.
"In his earlier days, when young, gallant, and
winsome, with an honoured name and spotless
scutcheon, Randal Clermont became my lover and
my husband.  Oh, how happy I was for a time;
how loving and beloved!  But a change came over
the unstable heart of my husband.  His political
intrigues and private excesses soon ruined our
fortune, deprived me of his love and him of my
esteem.  We were driven into exile, and retired
to Paris.  There he plunged madly into a vortex
of the lowest dissipation, and spent the last of my
dowry, my jewels, and everything.  He became a
drunkard, a bully, and a gamester, if not worse.
Long, long I endured without a murmur or
reproach his pitiless cruelty and cutting contempt,
until he eloped with one who in better days had
been my companion and attendant, an artful wretch
named Beatrix Gilruth.  He joined the army of
Mareschal Crecquy as a volunteer, and I saw him
no more.  Hearing afterwards that he was in
Scotland fighting under the standard of the
Covenant, and being driven to despair by the miseries
into which he had plunged me, by leaving me a
prey to destitution in a foreign land, I resolved to
quit the world for ever; I have come of an old
Catholic family, and a convent was my first thought.
</p>

<p>
"Our child, for we had one, our child was
alternately a source of torment and delight,"
continued the poor nun, weeping bitterly&mdash;"my
torment from the resemblance it bore to its
perfidious father, and my delight as the only tie that
bound me to earth; I resolved to see it no more,
and sent the poor infant to Scotland in charge
of a faithful female servitor, to whom I gave a
letter for my husband, purporting to be written on
my deathbed, and a ring he had given me in
happier days.  In an agony of grief I saw the woman
depart, and gave her all I possessed, a few
louis-d'ors I had acquired at Paris, where I had
supported myself as a fleuriste, and was patronized by
the Scottish Archers, who were ever very kind to
me.  I considered myself as dead to the world
from that hour, and immediately commenced my
noviciate in the licensed convent of St. Ursula in
French Flanders.
</p>

<p>
"Here again all the wounds of my heart were
torn open by tidings that the ship in which my
loved little boy and his nurse embarked had
perished at sea; whether they perished too God
alone knoweth, for I heard of them no more.  And
now the fierce stings of remorse increased the
sadness of my sorrow, and I upbraided myself
with cruelty, with lack of fortitude and such
resignation as became a Christian.  I accused myself
of infanticide, and in my thoughts by day and my
dreams by night I had ever before me the sunny
eyes and golden hair of my little child, and its
lisping accents in my dreaming ear awoke me to
tears and unavailing sorrow."
</p>

<p>
Here the poor nun again paused and wept bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Time never fails to soften the memory of the
most acute sorrow, and in the convent to which I
had fled for refuge from my own thoughts, the
soothing consolations of the sisterhood, the calm,
the pious and blameless tenor of their way, charmed
me as much as their holy meekness of spirit
subdued my bitter regrets.  After a time I tasted the
sweets of the most perfect contentment, if not of
happiness.  In the duties of religion, of industry
and charity, I soon learned to forget Clermistonlee,
or to remember him only in my prayers&mdash;to
forget that I had been a wife, to forget that I had
been&mdash;oh, no! not a mother&mdash;never could I forget
that."
</p>

<p>
"Villain that he is! and with the consciousness
of your Ladyship's existence, he has, since he was
ennobled, wooed many another to be his bride;
but Heaven's hand or his own vices have always
foiled him."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the recluse sparkled beneath her
veil; but folding her white hands meekly on her
bosom, she said with exceeding gentleness&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What have I to do with it now?&mdash;besides,
youth, I am sure he believes me dead, for some of
the Scottish Archers told him so&mdash;and dead I am
to him and to the world."
</p>

<p>
"It is a very sad history, madam,"
</p>

<p>
"But God has comforted me."  Her tears fell
fast nevertheless, and a long pause ensued.  Walter
felt himself moved to tears, and he often sighed
deeply, yet knew not why.
</p>

<p>
The sound of a trumpet roused him; it seemed
close bye, and came in varying cadence on the
passing wind.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the trumpet of a Dutch patrole.  I must
begone, lady, or remain only to die.  Farewell; a
thousand blessings on you and a thousand more&mdash;for
we shall never meet again;" and half kneeling
he kissed her hand, and, slipping from the
cottage, favoured by the darkened moon, hurried
away towards the fires of Luxembourg's camp,
just as a party of Dutch Ruyters led by the boor
halted at the cottage door.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
With fifty thousand men the Mareschal Duke of
Luxembourg was posted at Courtray on the Lys;
while William, with twice that number, lay at
Grammont, inactive, phlegmatic, and afraid to
attack him; an inertness which increased the
growing ill-humour of Britain against him.
Without a dinner and without a sou, abandoned to
solitude and dejection, Walter Fenton one
evening paced slowly to and fro on the ramparts of
Courtray, watching the bright sunset as it
lingered long on the level scenery.  A page
approached, who acquainted him that Monseigneur
le Mareschal required his presence in the citadel,
whither he immediately repaired, and found the
great Henri of Luxembourg, the youthful Dukes
of Chartres and Vendome, with other chevaliers of
distinction, carousing after a sumptuous repast.
</p>

<p>
As he entered, De Chartres was singing the
merry old ditty of <i>Jean de Nivelle</i>, while the rest
chorused.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Jean de Nivelle has three flails;<br />
  Three palfrays with long manes and tails;<br />
  Three blades of a terrible brand,<br />
  Which he never takes into his hand.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ah! ouivraiment!<br />
  Jean de Nivelle est bon enfant!</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The magnificence of their attire, the happy
nonchalance and graceful ease of their manner,
contrasted with his own tattered and humble
uniform, fallen fortune, and jaded spirit, made
Walter's heart sick as he entered; but, assuming
somewhat of the old air of a cavalier officer, he
bowed to the noble company, and awaited in
silence the commands of the Mareschal.
</p>

<p>
"Approach, Monsieur," said the handsome
young Duc de Chartres.  "Tête Dieu! but you
look very pale!  You were wounded I believe?"
</p>

<p>
"It is nearly healed Monseigneur,"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, it is deuced unpleasant work this fighting
and beleaguering."
</p>

<p>
"De Chartres would rather be at Chantilly,"
said the Duc de Vendome, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Or at Versailles," said a Chevalier of
St. Louis.  "He is thinking of little Mariette
Gondalaurier."
</p>

<p>
"Or St. Denis and adorable Isabeau Lagrange."
</p>

<p>
"Say Paris at once, Messieurs," said the boyish
roué, smiling.  "I have beauties everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"The Scottish officer will drink with us&mdash;here,
boy, assist our friend to wine," said Luxembourg
to his page.  "'Tis only Frontiniac, Monsieur;
but an hour ago it was Dutch William's, and we
drink it out of pure spite."
</p>

<p>
Walter drank the fragrant wine from a
massively embossed cup, and his head swam as he
imbibed it, and waited to hear for what desperate
duty these noble peers designed him.
</p>

<p>
"Chevalier," said Luxembourg with his most
bland smile, "it is pleasant to reward the brave.
Aware that the repulse of the confederate cavalry
on my right flank, and consequently the whole
success of that glorious day at Steinkirke was
mainly owing to the valour of the Scottish
cavaliers animated by your example, King Louis sends
you this."  And taking from his own neck the
sparkling cross of the recently created order of
St. Louis, the Duke placed it around the neck of
Walter Fenton, who bowed his thanks in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Go, Chevalier&mdash;you are a gallant soldier!
The Scots were ever brave, and the friends of
France.  Wear that cross with honour to the
Most Christian King, to your native country&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And to the most sublime Madame Maintenon,"
said the young Duke, and his gay companions
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Monseigneur!" said Luxembourg warningly.
</p>

<p>
"Tête Dieu, Mareschal! dost think I fear her?
Faith Madame, 'tis known, never gives a favour
without a most usurious per centage.  She is
quite a Jewess in the intrigues of love and politics,
ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Attached to this cross, Chevalier, is a pension
of four hundred livres yearly, which I doubt not
will be acceptable in your present reduced
circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, believe me, Monseigneur le Mareschal,
and you most noble Dukes, it is indeed most
acceptable; for with it I may in some sort alleviate
the miseries of those gallant gentlemen, my
comrades, who share your fortunes in the field."
</p>

<p>
"By St. Denis, you are a gallant fellow!" cried
Luxembourg with kindling eyes, "Your generosity
equals your courage.  But this must not
be.  Messieurs your comrades must take the will
for the deed.  This night you must depart for the
Court of St. Germain-en-laye, where King James
requires your immediate attendance.  My
Secretary will supply you with money, and my Master
of the Horse with a charger&mdash;adieu, Sir, and God
be with you!"
</p>

<p>
Walter retired.
</p>

<p>
That night he bade a sad adieu to his comrades,
and, mounted on one of the Mareschal's horses,
departed from Courtray.
</p>

<p>
His brave companions in glory and exile he
saw no more.  After all their services and their
sufferings, their achievements and their chivalry,
the few survivors of the war, sixteen in number,
were, by a striking example of French ingratitude,
disbanded at the peace of Ryswick, on the upper
part of the Rhine, far from their native
land&mdash;without money or any provision to save them
from starvation and death.  Of these sixteen
only <i>four</i> survived to return to Scotland in
extreme old age, when all fears of the Jacobites had
passed away for ever.
</p>

<p>
Again the unclouded moon was shining over
Steinkirke when Walter passed it, and vividly on
his mind came back the fierce memories of that
impetuous hour.  The great plain was deserted,
the full eared corn was waving heavily, and not a
sound disturbed the silence of the moonlit scenery
save the deep bay of a household dog or the croak
of a passing stork.
</p>

<p>
Thickly on every hand lay the graves of the
faithful dead.  In some instances he saw great
burial mounds; in others there was but one
solitary grave secluded among the long grass and
reeds, and his horse started instinctively as he
passed them.
</p>

<p>
Fragments of clothing, accoutrements, and
other relics, lay among the rank weeds by the
side of the fields, under the green hedge-rows, in
the wet ditches; and even fleshless bones, bare
scalps, fingers and toes, protruded from the soil,
imparting an aspect of horror to the moonlighted
plain where the battle had been fought.
</p>

<p>
The abbatis still lay there, but the foliage of
the trees that formed it had long since faded and
decayed.  A great tumulus, on which the young
grass was sprouting, lay within it.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Finland!" muttered Walter, and with a
moistened eye and heavy heart he plunged his
horse into the Senne and swam to the opposite
bank.  The cottage where he had found shelter
had now disappeared; its foundations, scorched
and blackened by fire, alone marked the place
where it stood.  He thought of the poor Ursuline
and her story, and sighed that he could learn
nothing more of her fate; he sighed, too, at the
memory of the beautiful Margaret Mackay, and
felt the keenest remorse for having slain her
father.
</p>

<p>
Of the recluse he never heard more; but the
daughter of Mackay reached the camp of William
in safety, and in after years became the wife of
her kinsman and chief, George, third Lord Reay
of Farre.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
WALTER FENTON AND THE KING.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  To daunton me, and me sae young,<br />
  And guid King James's auldest son!<br />
  Oh, that's the thing that never can be,<br />
  For the man is unborn that'll daunton me!<br />
  O set me once upon Scottish land,<br />
  With my guid braid-sword into my hand,<br />
  My bannet blue aboon my bree,<br />
  Then shew me the man that'll daunton me!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JACOBITE RELIQUES.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
His confessor had just withdrawn, and King
James was sitting in his closet involved in gloomy
and distracting reverie&mdash;immersed in thoughts
which even the mild exhortations of the priest
had failed to soothe, and with his eyes intently
fixed on the morning sun as it rose red and
unclouded in the east, he gave way to the sadness
that oppressed him.
</p>

<p>
Alternately he was a prey to a storm of revengeful
and bitter political reflections, or to a gloomy
fanaticism, which impaired the courage and
lessened the magnanimity for which he had once
been distinguished.  On discovering that he was
constantly conferring with the Jesuits upon
abstruse theology, the ribald Louis spoke of him in
terms of pity mingled with contempt.  The
French ridiculed, the Romans lampooned him,
and, while the Sovereign Pontiff supplied him
liberally with indulgences, the Archbishop of
Rheims said ironically&mdash;"There is a pious man
who hath sacrificed three crowns for a mass!"
</p>

<p>
And this was all the unfortunate and mistaken
James had gained, by his steady and devoted
adherence to a falling faith.
</p>

<p>
Bestowing a glance of undisguised hostility, not
unmingled with contempt, at the follower of
St. Ignatius Loyola as he withdrew, the Earl of
Dunbarton, clad in his old uniform as a Scottish
general, entered the apartment of the King.  The
green ribbon of St. Andrew was worn over his
left shoulder, the star with its four silver points
sparkled on his left breast, and around his neck
hung the red ribbon of the Bath, and the
magnificent collar of the Garter.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, my Lord Dunbarton; you
look as if you had something to communicate.
Any news from Flanders?  Is my dutiful son-in-law
still playing at long bowles with Luxembourg?
Has Sir Walter Fenton arrived?"
</p>

<p>
"He awaits your Majesty's pleasure in the
ante-chamber."
</p>

<p>
"Let him be introduced at once!  Why all this
etiquette?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, please your Majesty, it is all that is
left to remind me of other days."
</p>

<p>
"True," said the King thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, my brave and faithful soldier!" he
exclaimed, as Walter was introduced by the
gentlemen in waiting, and kneeled to kiss his
hand.  "Welcome from Flanders, that land of
fighting and fertility.  My poor Sir Walter, you
look very pale and emaciated."
</p>

<p>
"I was wounded at Steinkirke, please your
Majesty; and with those unfortunate gentlemen,
my comrades, have undergone such hardships and
humiliations as no imagination can conceive."
</p>

<p>
Walter's eyes suffused with tears; his voice and
his heart trembled.  He felt a gush of loyalty and
ardour swelling within his breast, that would have
enabled him cheerfully to lay his life at the feet of
the King.  The remark of a celebrated modern
writer is indeed a true one.  "Unfortunate and
unwise as were the Stuart family, there must
have been some charm about them, for they had
instances of attachment and fidelity shewn them
of which <i>no other line of Kings could boast</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You have indeed undergone sufferings which
God only can reward," said the King, laying a
hand kindly on his shoulder; "and your ill
requited valour is a striking example of the
falsehood and flattery of the Court of Versailles."
</p>

<p>
"When I consider our achievements," replied
Walter, "my soul fires with pride and ardour;
but when I think of the friends that have fallen,
my heart dies away within me.  To the last of my
blood and breath I will serve your majesty; but,
notwithstanding this gift of the Cross of
St. Louis, I will follow the banner of the donor no
more."
</p>

<p>
"Louis is a noble prince," said the Earl of
Dunbarton, "and one who hath raised his realm
to the greatest pitch of human grandeur."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, say not so, my Lord!  When I remember
the cruel persecution of his subjects after
the Treaty of Nimguen, his repealing the edict of
Nantes, his tyranny over the noblesse and the
parliament, his unjust wars and usurpations, in
which he pours forth so prodigally the blood and
the treasures of his people; his blasphemous
titles and lewd life; I can only remember with
shame that I have served in his army, and from
this hour renounce his service for ever.  And
were it not that this cross hung once on the
breast of the gallant Luxembourg, I would hurl it
into the Seine."
</p>

<p>
"The remembrance of your sufferings doubtless
animates this unwise train of thought, Sir Walter,"
said the King, slightly piqued.  "But permit me
to remark, that to indulge your opinions thus in
France, is to run your head into the lion's mouth.
How goes the war in Flanders?"
</p>

<p>
"Still doubtfully, please your Majesty; but the
recent arrival of the Duke of Leinster at Ostend,
with fresh troops for William, may turn the
fortune of the war against Henri of Luxembourg,
and consequently please the people of England,
who are not very favourably disposed towards
this expensive and unnecessary war for the Dutch
interests of the usurper."
</p>

<p>
"The best proof of this new sentiment, is the
discontent of the Cameronians in the western
districts of Scotland.  What dost think, Sir
Walter?  They have engaged to muster 5000
horse and 20,000 infantry for my complete
restoration, provided Louis will give them only one
month's subsidy, beside other supplies, and these
he hath solemnly promised me."
</p>

<p>
"From my soul I thank Heaven that again it is
turning the hearts of your subjects towards you.
If such is the spirit of the Cameronians, oh, what
will be the energy and the ardour of the Cavaliers!
But trust not in Louis; he has ruined every
prince with whom he has been allied, in war or in
politics, and assuredly he will shipwreck the
interests of your Majesty, as he has done those of
others."
</p>

<p>
"Still judging hardly of his most Christian
Majesty," said James, smiling.  "But I have the
pledged words of better men.  From the noble
Drummonds', the gallant Keiths', the Hays', from
the Lord Stormont and the Murrays', the gay
Gordons and Grahames, I have received the most
solemn promises of adherence and loyalty; and I
know that the glorious clans of the northern
shires will all rush to my standard the moment it
is unfurled upon the Highland hills.  Oh, yes!"
continued the King, while his dark eyes flashed
with joyous enthusiasm; "once again as in my
father's days the war-cry of the Gael will ring
from Lochness to Lochaber."
</p>

<p>
"But where is now Montrose, and where
Dundee?" said Lord Dunbarton in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"God will raise up other champions for those
who have suffered so much in his service as the
Princes of the House of Stuart," replied the King
with Catholic fervour and confidence.  "Meantime,
Sir Walter, I would have you to set out for
Scotland forthwith, to negotiate with those
distinguished cavaliers, while the minds of my people
are still inflamed by the memory of that fiend-like
massacre at Glencoe, the defeat of Steinkirke,
the slaughter of their soldiers, and all the disgusts
incident to the Flemish campaign abroad and
William's administration at home.  My Lord
Dunbarton avers that he will pledge his honour
for the loyalty of his old regiment and the Scottish
Guards, both horse and foot, for his Countess has
questioned every man of them.  You will not fail
to visit Drummond of Hawthorndon; he comes
of a leal and true race, and his house, with its
deep caverns and secret outlets, is a noble place
of rendezvous and security.  You will be liberally
supplied with money and letters of credit and
compliment.  You may promise, in my name,
everything that seems requisite&mdash;titles, honours,
pensions,&mdash;I will trust to your discretion, from
what the Lord Dunbarton has told me of you.
Flatter the vain, conciliate the stubborn, secure
the wavering, and fire the loyal.  Leave nothing
undone, and remember that, perhaps on the
success of your mission depend the fortune of the
prince, my son, the ancient liberties of Scotland,
the honour of her people, and the fate of her
regal line."
</p>

<p>
The King ceased, and Walter was so
overwhelmed by the magnitude of the diplomacy
entrusted to him, and the joy at returning to
Scotland, that he remained silent for some moments.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, with what a mission does your Majesty
honour me!" he exclaimed, glowing with ambition,
gratitude and joy.  "How can I express my
thanks for this great confidence reposed in one so
poor, so friendless?"
</p>

<p>
"These are good qualities, Sir Walter, for a
Jacobite agent; you may (being friendless and
unknown) make your way through Scotland in
safety, when a coroneted baron, or the chief of a
powerful sept, would soon be discovered and
committed to the Castle of Edinburgh or the Tower
of London.  Go, Sir Walter; Lord Dunbarton
and my secretary will arrange the matters you
require, and in addition to my holograph letters
to the Lowland lords and Highland chiefs, will
give you others to Mr. Brown, my English agent,
and Father Innes, President of the Scots' College
at Paris, who acts for me in Scotland.  Go, Sir
Walter, and prosper!  If ever we meet again, let
us hope it will be under very different
circumstances.  May God and his thrice-blessed mother
keep their hands over you, and inspire you for the
sake of my dear little son and the people over
whom he is to rule!  Farewell&mdash;I have in some
sort rewarded your courage in the field, but if
your talent in diplomacy equals it, I swear by the
sceptre that my sires have borne for ages, you
shall be Earl of Dalrulion in the north, and cock
your beaver with the best peer in all broad
Scotland.  Farewell! may we meet again at the
head of a loyal and faithful army, or part to meet
no more!"
</p>

<p>
Again Walter Fenton kneeled, and after kissing
the hand of James, was hurried away by the Earl
of Dunbarton.
</p>

<p>
Furnished with a great number of letters
addressed to the principal nobles and chiefs in
Scotland, Walter artfully sewed them into the
lining of his hat and the stiff buckram skirts of
his coat, after which, without an hour's delay, he
departed on his arduous and dangerous mission&mdash;to
overturn the established governments of two
kingdoms&mdash;to hurl down one dynasty and restore
another.
</p>

<p>
Already he had gained a title which formerly he
had possessed only in his day-dreams of success
and glory; but now decorated by Louis with his
new and famous military order, promised a
peerage by his King, fired by loyalty, ardour, and
love, he seemed to occupy a giddy eminence, from
which he viewed distinctly a long and happy
future.
</p>

<p>
It was a far-stretching and glorious vista of
triumph and success; the restoration of the king
by his means, and oh, far above all,&mdash;the exultation
of placing a Countess's coronet on the bright
tresses of Lilian Napier.
</p>

CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE RETURNED EXILE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Then, Mary, turn awa'<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bonnie face o' thine;<br />
  Oh, dinna shew the breast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never can be mine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Wi' love's severest pangs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is laden sair;<br />
  And owre my breast the grass maun grow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I am free from care.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the gloaming of an evening in the autumn
of 1693 a man left the western gate of Edinburgh,
and, skirting the suburb of the Highriggs, struck
into the roadway between the fields.
</p>

<p>
The sickly rays of a yellow sun shining faintly
through the mist after throwing the shadows of
the gigantic castle far to the eastward, had died
away, and a deeper gloom succeeding, denoted the
close of the day as the fall of the fluttering leaves
did that of the dreary year.
</p>

<p>
The stranger was Walter Fenton; but how
changed in aspect and attire!  His form was thin
and emaciated, his cheek pale, his eyes sunken
from the pain of his wound and the toil of
campaigning; but his step was as free, and his bearing
erect as ever.  His attire was of the plainest grey
freize, with great horn buttons; a brown scratch
wig and a plain beaver hat concealed the dark
locks that curled beneath them; he carried a
walking staff in lieu of a sword, and appeared to
lean on it a little at times.  He was now in the
character of a Low Country merchant, and,
favoured by a passport from the conservator of
Scottish privileges at Campvere, had an hour
before landed from the good ship Fame of
Queensferry, at the ancient wooden pier of Leith.
</p>

<p>
Often he made brief pauses to view the desolate
scene around him; for in that year a heavy
curse seemed to have fallen upon the desolate
kingdom of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
On an evening in the preceding summer, when
everything was blooming and smiling&mdash;when the
land was rich with verdure and the woods were
heavy with foliage, a cold wind came from the
eastward, and, accompanied by a dense and
sulphureous mist, swept over the face of the country,
blighting whatsoever was touched by its pestilential
breath.
</p>

<p>
The fields seemed to whiten under its baleful
influence; the ripening corn withered, and the
land was struck with a barrenness.  Dense,
opaque, and palpable, like a chain of hills, this
strange and horrid vapour lay floating in the
valleys for many successive months, and there its
effects were more disastrous.  The heat of the
sun seemed to diminish, the insects disappeared
from the air and the birds from the withered
woods, which, long ere the last month of summer,
became divested of their faded foliage.  The cattle
became dwarfish and meagre, and the flocks
perished by scores on the decaying heather of the
blasted mountains.  The people became sickly,
ghastly, and prostrated in spirit; for a curse
seemed to have fallen upon the land and all that
was in it.
</p>

<p>
This terrible visitation continued until the year
1701, and the <i>dear years</i> were long remembered
with horror in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
In some places, January and February became
the months of harvest, and, amid ice and snow,
and the sleet that drizzled through that everlasting
and sulphureous mist, the half famished people
reaped in grief and misery a small part of their
scanty produce, while the other was left to rot in
the ground.  Famine, the lord of all, stalked
grimly over the land, and strong men and wailing
women, yea, and feeble children, fought like wild
beasts for a handful of meal in the desolate market
places.
</p>

<p>
"There was many a blank and pale face in
Scotland," says Walker, the famous Presbyterian
pedlar, "and as the famine waxed sore, wives
thought not of their husbands, nor husbands of
their wives," and the gloomy superstition and
fanatical intolerance of the time added fresh horrors
to this ghastly scourge.
</p>

<p>
The famine was not yet at its height; but there
was a desolation in the aspect of the land that
deeply impressed the mind of the returned exile,
and he sighed in unison with the dreary wind as it
swept over the blasted muir, shaking down the
crisped leaves and acorns of stately old oaks of
Drumsheugh.  Save the solitary heron, wading as
of old in the lake, not a bird was to be seen, not
an insect buzzing about the leafless hedges.  The
air was dense and cold, and all was very still.
</p>

<p>
The country seemed to be wasting like a
beautiful woman decaying in consumption.  Walter
felt that the manners of the people were changed;
intense gravity and moroseness, real or affected,
were visible in every face, while sad coloured
garments, Geneva cloaks, and Dutch fashions
were all the rage.  Every trace of the smart
mustache had disappeared, and with it the slashed
doublets, the waving feathers and dashing airs of
the gallant cavaliers.
</p>

<p>
Even the sentinels at the palace gates and the
portes of the city, might have passed for those
before the Town House or <i>Rasp Haus</i> at Amsterdam.
The smart steel cap of the old Scottish
infantry had now given place to a vast overshadowing
beaver looped up on three sides, and the
scarlet doublet slashed with blue, and the jacket
of spotless buff, to square tailed and voluminous
coats of brick-red, with yellow breeches and belts
worn saltier-wise.
</p>

<p>
Bitterly the reflection came home to the heart
of the poor Cavalier, that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The times were changed, old manners gone,<br />
  And a <i>stranger</i> filled the Stuarts' throne!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Though confident of succeeding in his diplomacy
with the loyal lords and chieftains of the
Jacobite faction, he was well aware how arduous
and difficult was the task to overthrow two
Governments so well arranged, ably constituted and
supported, as those of England and Scotland.  It
had long been the policy of William III. to
conciliate domestic enemies, and, in pursuance of it,
he had bestowed several lucrative offices on the
leaders of the discontented and kirk-party.  The
Scottish Parliament, which had recently met,
received from him an able and cunning letter,
replete with flattering and cajoling expressions,
which put all the Presbyterian Lords in such
excellent humour, that they returned a most
dutiful and affectionate address&mdash;granted him a supply
of six new battalions of infantry, a body of
seamen, and one hundred and fifty thousand pounds,
to enable him to carry on his useless wars with
new vigour; but though the Parliament was thus
obsequious, the people were far from being
pleased; and the Jacobites, numerous, enthusiastic,
and determined, every where fanned the
flames of discord and dissension.
</p>

<p>
The institution of fines and oaths of assurance
upon absentees from Parliament, which had direct
reference to certain Cavalier Lords and lesser
Barons, exasperated them as much as the horrible
massacre of Glencoe did the commonalty, who
raised throughout the land a cry for vengeance on
William and his Government.
</p>

<p>
Walter Fenton reflected on these things as he
walked onward, and knew that he had come at a
critical time.  Other thoughts soon succeeded,
and, grasping his staff as he had often done his
sword, he pushed forward with a sparkling eye
and reddening cheek.
</p>

<p>
Without impairing his nobler sentiments, suffering
and misfortune had powerfully strengthened
his loyalty and virtue, as much as campaigning
had improved his bearing and lent a firmness and
manly determination to his aspect; but often his
brow saddened and the fire of his eye died away,
when he thought of Finland and those he had
been permitted to survive and to mourn.
</p>

<p>
Glowing with sensations of rapture, and eagerly
anticipating the flush of joy that awaited him, he
passed the rhinns of the beautiful loch, the curious
gable-ended old house where once the Regent
Murray dwelt, and approached the gate of Bruntisfield.
</p>

<p>
His heart beat painfully; he was deeply
agitated.  Five weary years had elapsed since he
had stood on that spot, and it seemed only as
yesterday.  Through all the hurry of events that
had swept over him, his memory went back to
that memorable eve of September (of which this
was now the anniversary) and to the glorious
ardour that animated his heart on the day he
marched for England, when the long line of the
Scottish host wound over yonder hill before him.
Oh, for one hour more of those fierce longings
and brave impulses!  But alas! the spirit seemed
to have passed away for ever.
</p>

<p>
He approached the avenue.  The old gate with
its massive arch, its mossy carvings and
loopholed wall, had given place to a handsome new
erection of more modern architecture, surmounted
by a rich coat of arms; and Walter felt every
pulse grow still, and every fibre tremble as he
surveyed the sculptured blazon.
</p>

<p>
It bore the saltire of Napier, engrailed between
four roses, but quartered, collared, and coroneted
with other bearings.
</p>

<p>
His heart became sick and palsied.  Oh, it was
a horrible sensation that came over him; he stood
long irresolute and apprehensive.
</p>

<p>
"Of what am I afraid!" he suddenly exclaimed
with the enthusiasm of a true and impassioned
lover.  "There is some mistake here; the house
has been sold or gifted away like many another
noble patrimony to the slaves of the Statholder.
Lilian!  Dear Lilian, when shall I hold thee in
my arms?"
</p>

<p>
He was about to rush forward, when a horseman,
the glittering lace on whose bright coloured suit
of triple velvet, and waving ostrich feathers that
fluttered in his diamond hat-band, formed a strong
contrast to the sombre fashions of the time, dashed
down the leaf-strewn avenue on a beautiful charger,
with the perfumed ringlets of his white peruke
dancing in the wind&mdash;for white perukes, from a
spirit of opposition, were all the rage then, as
<i>black</i> had been under the three last princes of the
old hereditary line.  It was Lord Clermistonlee.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo, fellow!" he cried imperiously, "keep
out of my horse's way&mdash;dost want thy bones
broken!" and giving a keen but casual glance at
the dejected wanderer, he spurred onward to the
city.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he reined up so sharply as almost to
pull his pawing steed back upon its strained and
bending haunches.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis he!" exclaimed the proud lord, as he
thought aloud.  "By the great father of
confusion 'tis he!  How could I mistake, though
truly, poor devil, these last five years have sadly
changed him.  But on what fool's errand comes
he here?  By all the furies, I knew his
lachrymose visage in a moment, though the despatches
of Dalrymple of Stair, to our Lords of Council,
had in some sort prepared me for his return, and
for what?&mdash;to organize a plot for James's restoration.
Poor fool!  Infatuated in love as in politics.
He believes in the faith of women and the word
of Kings; let us see how they will avail him tonight."
</p>

<p>
He smiled scornfully, and twisted the heavy
dark mustachios which he still cherished with
more than Mahommedan veneration.  Alternately
sad and bitter thoughts swelled within him as he
remembered the joyous revelry of King Charles's
days, and the tyranny he could then exercise
over all nonconformists, and the hunting and
hosting-dragooning and drinking of the Covenanting
wars; then came feelings of jealousy and revenge
that, as they blazed up in his proud breast, bore
all before them.
</p>

<p>
"How dares he now to prowl before my own
gates?  Gadso! if my Lady Lilian sees him once,
there will be a pretty disturbance.  A shipload of
devils will be nothing to it.  The girl will die,
and my own house will become too hot to hold
me.  D&mdash;&mdash;nation! too well have I seen the
secret passion that has preyed upon her gentle
and affectionate heart&mdash;the grief&mdash;the deep
consuming grief that all my magnificent presents and
gentle blandishments have failed to soothe.  A
thousand curses on this upstart beggar, and a
thousand more on the mother of mischief, who
has raised him up again to cross my path!  By
what power hath he escaped war and woe, and
storm and every danger again to thwart and come
in the way of Clermistonlee, whose purposes were
never yet foiled by man, or woman either?
'S death! the time has come when the cord of the
doomster, or the axe of the maiden, must rid me
for ever of this old source of dark forebodings and
secret inquietude.  Ho, for a guard and a warrant
of Council, and then Sir Walter Fenton, Knight
Banneret, the Jacobite spy, Chevalier of St. Louis,
ex-private soldier, and soi-disant ensign to the
Lord Dunbarton, may look to himself!  Ha, ha!"
and dashing spurs into his horse he galloped
madly into the city.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE BUBBLE BURST.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  To linger when the sun of life,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beam that gilt its path is gone&mdash;<br />
  To feel the aching bosom's strife,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <i>Hope</i> is dead, but <i>Love</i> lives on.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANONYMOUS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meanwhile, without recognising Clermistonlee,
and not aware that he had been recognized
by him, poor Walter, who was of that temperament
which is easily raised and depressed, turned
away from the gate, crushed beneath the load of a
thousand fears at the sight of so gay a cavalier
caracoling down the avenue of Bruntisfield.
</p>

<p>
His heart was overcharged with melancholy
reflections.  "I have been away for five years&mdash;in
all that time we have never heard of each other.
Oh, what if she should have deemed me dead!"
</p>

<p>
Drawing his last shilling from his pocket, the
unfortunate cavalier entered a poor change-house
by the wayside, where a great signboard creaking
on an iron rod and representing a portrait in a red
coat and white wig, and having a tremendously
hooked nose, imported that it was the 'King
William's head,' kept by Lucky Elshender, who
promised good entertainment for "man and
beast."
</p>

<p>
The small clay-floored apartment, with its
well-scrubbed bunkers, and rack of shining plates and
tin trenchers, kirn-babies on the mantelpiece, and
blazing ingle, where turf and wood burned cheerfully
in a clumsy iron basket, supported by four
massive legs, looked very snug and comfortable.
</p>

<p>
A personage evidently a divine, long visaged
and dark featured, with his lanky sable hair falling
on his Geneva bands and coat of rusty black, sat
warming his spindle legs at the warm hearth, and
smoking a long pipe, on the bowl of which he
fixed his great lack lustre eyes with an
expression of the deepest abstraction.  It was the
Reverend Mr. Ichabod Bummel, who came every
evening as regularly as six o'clock struck, to
smoke a pipe, and hear the passing news at the
change-house kept by his aunt-in-law old Elsie,
and to bore every traveller who was disposed to
hear the abstruse theology and ponderous
arguments advanced in his <i>Bombshell</i>, for that
immortal work had been printed at last, in thick
quarto, and a copy of it now lay under his elbow
all ready for action against the first good-natured
listener or fool-hardy disputant.
</p>

<p>
In person this redoubtable champion of toleration
was as lean as ever, though the goods and
chattels of this world had flowed amply upon him
of late, notwithstanding the oppression and famine
of the time.  He had cautiously purchased various
tofts and pendicles on the banks of the Powburn,
and to these he gave hard and unusual scriptural
names, which they bear unto this day, and
which the curious may find by consulting the
City Directory.  One he named the Land of
Canaan, another the Land of Goshen, the Land of
Egypt, Hebron, and so forth, while the little
runnel that traverses them was exalted into the
waters of Jordan.  Meinie, whom he had espoused,
had "proved," as he said, "ane fruitful vine," for
she had brought him four sons, all long-visaged,
hollow-eyed, and sepulchral counterparts of
himself, and he named them Shem, Ham, Japhet, and
Ichabod.
</p>

<p>
On the opposite side of the ingle, and far back
in a corner, a miserable-looking woman crouched
on the stone bench for warmth.  A tartan plaid
was muffled about her shoulders, and half concealed
her hollow cheeks and ghastly visage.  She seemed
a personification of the famine and misery that
reigned so triumphantly in Scotland.  Her eyes
were full of unnatural lustre; they flashed like
diamonds in the light of the fire, but had a
scrutinizing and stern expression in them that startled
Walter, and he felt uneasy in her vicinity.
</p>

<p>
"It's only puir Beatrix Gilruth, my winsome
gentleman," said Elsie in a low voice; "she is a
gomeral&mdash;a natural body that bides about the doors,
Sir; just a puir, harmless, daft creature.  She'll
no harm you, Sir."
</p>

<p>
In the tumult of his mind Walter did not at first
recognise either Elsie or Ichabod, but assuming
an air of as much unconcern as he could muster,
he called for a bicker of French wine, and took
possession of a cutty stool which the slipshod
Elsie placed for him hurriedly and officiously
opposite the divine, who regarded him with a keen
scrutinizing glance, to ascertain his probable
station in life, his errand, and objects in coming
hither.  He saw that he was a traveller, and being
on foot must be a poor one.
</p>

<p>
"Good e'en to your reverence, for I presume I
have the honour of addressing a clergyman," said
Walter, politely.
</p>

<p>
"Hum&mdash;humph!" answered Ichabod, with a
short cough, nodding his head, and never once
moving his eyes from Walter's face.  Every man
was then doubtful and suspicious of strangers (the
Scots are so to the present hour), and consequently
Ichabod was singularly dry and reserved.  But
Elsie drew near Walter, and looked at him
attentively.  The grief that preyed upon his heart had
imparted a singularly prepossessing mildness to
his features, and a winning cadence to the tone of
his voice, but the stark preacher neither saw one
nor felt the influence of the other.
</p>

<p>
"A cold night, your reverence."
</p>

<p>
"Yea," gasped Ichabod, and there was another
pause.
</p>

<p>
"My service to you, Sir.  Wilt taste my wine? 'tis
right Gascony, and I should be a judge."
</p>

<p>
"Yea, having been in those parts where it was
produced, probably," observed Ichabod, becoming
more curious and communicative as he imbibed
the lion's share of Walter's wine pot, and waited
for an answer, but there was none given.
</p>

<p>
"Verily, Sir," began Mr. Bummel, "these are
times to chill the souls and bodies of the afflicted.
Thou seest how sore the famine waxeth in the
land, especially in these our once fertile Lothians,
which whilome were wont to be overflowing with
milk and honey."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," chimed in Elsie, "but I've seen them
in mair fearfu' times, when they were overflowing
wi' blude and soldiers."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis for that red harvest, woman, that we are
visited by this lamentable scourge; plagued even
as Egypt was of old.  In these three fertile shires
of Lothian I have seen a woeful change since the
last harvest, and my heart grows heavy when I
think upon it; but I am about to arise and go
forth from them for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Sir," said Walter.
</p>

<p>
"I have gotten a pleasant call from the Lord
to another kirk&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wi' a <i>better</i> stipend, Sir," added the gleeful
Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Indubitably," said Mr. Bummel.
</p>

<p>
"Twa hunder pound Scots, a braw glebe, four
bolls o' beir," replied Elsie, counting on her
crooked and wrinkled fingers, "aucht chalders&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Peace, woman Elsie, for this enumeration of
thine savours of a love for the things of this life."
</p>

<p>
"And a braw pulpit.  O, but it's grand you'll
be, Ichabod, when in full birr under your sounding
board.  But alake, Sir," she added, turning to
Walter, "arena' these fearfu' times?'
</p>

<p>
"Sad indeed, gudewife."
</p>

<p>
"I was in the mealmarket this morning, and
oh, Sirs, it was a sight to rend the heart of a nether
millstane to see the hungry bairns and wailing
mothers worrying about the half-filled pokes.
God help them! the puir folk are deeing fast the
west country we hear."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a scourge on the land for its former sins,"
said the preacher in his most sepulchral tone;
"but let us hope that the faith of its people will
save it!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll hae come from some far awa' country
I'm thinking, Sir?" said Elsie, inquisitively, for
the extreme sadness of Walter interested her
extremely.
</p>

<p>
"True I have, good woman."
</p>

<p>
"France, I fancy? that land o' priests and persecution."
</p>

<p>
"From Holland last.  I am a merchant, and
deal in broadcloths and cart saddles.  From Holland
last," he repeated, for their inquisitiveness
made him uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"A blessed land, good youth," said Mr. Bummel.
"I sojourned there long when there was a
flaming sword over the children of righteousness."
</p>

<p>
"Reverend sir, canst tell me what are the news
among you here?" asked Walter, who was in an
agony of mind to lead the conversation to what
lay nearest his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Verily, Sir, nought but the famine&mdash;the famine.
The west winds hath detained the Flanders
mail these two months, and we have heard nothing
from London these many weeks, save anent plots
of the Jacobites and Papists, of whilk we have ever
enough and to spare."
</p>

<p>
"What have you heard of them of late?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis said that one Walter Fenton, formerly an
officer in the regiment of Dunbarton (that bloody
oppressor of Israel) is now tarrying among us,
plotting in James's cause, or on some such errand
of hell."
</p>

<p>
"The rascal," said Walter, drinking to conceal
the confusion that overspread his face.
</p>

<p>
"Yea," continued Ichabod, puffing vigorously,
and luckily involving himself in a cloud of smoke.
"This morning the heralds, in their vain-glorious
trumpery, were proclaiming at the Cross the
reward of a thousand merks to any that will bring
his head to the Privy Council; and the Lord
Clermistonlee, from the good will and affection he
bears his Majesty, offers five hundred more?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he will be found?"
</p>

<p>
"Indubitably.  The ports are closed, the guards
on the alert; the messengers-at-arms, macers, and
halberdiers are all in full chase.  He must perish,
and so may all who would restore the abominations
of idolatry!  Here in my <i>Bombshell</i> (a work whilk I
have lately imprinted with mickle care and toil), if
I do not prove, from the epistles to the
Thessalonians, that the great master of popery, the
Bishop of Rome, is the grand Antichrist therein
referred to, I will be well content to kiss the
bloody maiden that stands under the shadow of
the Tolbooth gable."
</p>

<p>
"Hear till him!" cried the delighted Elsie.
"Hear till him!  O wow, but my Meinie's man
is a grand minister&mdash;he rides on the rigging of the
kirk!"
</p>

<p>
"I am a stranger here," said Walter, no longer
able to repress the torture of his mind; "I know
nothing of the vile plot you speak of, having been
long in the industrious Low Countries&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;cans't
tell me, your Reverence, whose mansion
is approached by yonder stately avenue of oaks
and sycamores?"
</p>

<p>
"The House of Bruntisfield&mdash;called of old the
Wrytes."
</p>

<p>
"Aich ay," added Elsie, shaking her head
mournfully; "but a house o' wrongs now."
</p>

<p>
"Wherefore, gudewife?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a lang story, honoured Sir," replied Elsie,
drawing her stool nearer Walter, and knitting
very fast to hide her emotion.  "The auld line o'
the Napiers ended in a lassie, as bonnie a doo as
the Lowdens three could boast o', and mony came
frae baith far and near to the wooing and winning
o' her; but nane cam speed save a neer-do-weel-loon
o' a cavalier officer, to whom she plighted
heart and troth&mdash;and the plighting pledge was a
deid woman's ring.  As might be expected, the
hellicate cavalier gaed awa' to the wars and
plundering in the Lowlands of Holland, and sair my
young lady sorrowed for him; I ken that weel,
for I was her nurse, and mony a lang hour she
grat in my arms for her love that was far awa'.
At last word came frae Low Germanie that the
fause villain had married some unco' papistical
woman, and, in a mad fit o' black despair, my
lady accepted the most determined, if no the best
o' her suitors&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who?" asked Walter in an unearthly voice, and
feeling for the sword he wore no longer.  "Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Randal Lord Clermistonlee, and ehow! but
sair hath been the change in our gude auld barony
since then.  Her braw lands and farmsteadings,
her auld patrimony, baith haugh and holme, loch
and lea, brae and burn, are a' melting and fleeing
awa' by the wasterfu' extravagance o' the wildest
loon in a' braid Scotland.  Hawks and hounds,
revellers and roisterers, and ill-women, thrang the
great ha' house frae een to morn and morn till
eenin'; and sae, between the freaks and follies,
the pride and caprice o' her lord, my puir doo
Lilian leads the life o' a blessed martyr.  When
mad wi' wine and ill luck at the dice tables, he
rampages ower her like a Bull o' Bashan; while,
at other times, he just doats on her as a faither
would on a favourite bairn.  But, alake! doating
can never remove the misery that has closed over
her for the short time she'll likely be amang
us&mdash;for her heart is breaking fast&mdash;it is&mdash;it is!"
</p>

<p>
Here Elsie wept bitterly, and then resumed.
</p>

<p>
"Her marriage day was ane o' the darkest
dool to a' the barony, for on that miserable day
our auld lady died; and a' the leal servitors were
soon after expelled to mak' room for the broken
horse-coupers, ill-women and vagabonds, that
were ever and aye in the train o' the new lord."
</p>

<p>
While Elsie ran on thus, Walter heard her not.
His mind was a perfect chaos of distraction.
</p>

<p>
Oh, what a shock were these tidings to one
whose head was so full of romance and enthusiasm,
and whose heart was brimming with sensibility and
love!
</p>

<p>
He felt an utter prostration of every faculty,
and a deadly coldness seemed to pass over the
pulses of his heart.  He arose, and laying on the
table the last coin he possessed in the world,
hurried forth without waiting for change, and,
bent on some desperate deed, blind and reckless,
with anger, agony and despair in his soul, he
entered the dark shadowy avenue, and approached
the old castellated mansion&mdash;the place of so many
tender memories.

CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
LOVE AND MARRIAGE ARE TWO.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, these were only marks of joy, forsooth,<br />
  For his return in safety!  Were they so?<br />
  And so ye may believe, and so my words<br />
  May fall unheeded!  Be it so; what comes<br />
  Will nevertheless come.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGAMEMNON OF ÆSCHYLUS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The shadows of the gloomy evening had
deepened as he approached the ancient Place of
Bruntisfield, and its dark façade, its heavy
projecting turrets and barred casements, impressed
him with additional sadness.
</p>

<p>
The wind sighed down the lonely avenue, and
whirled the fallen leaves as it passed.  Many a
raven flapped its wings and screamed discordantly
above his head, and all such sounds had a
powerful effect on him at the time.
</p>

<p>
Confused, despairing, and feeling a sentiment
of profound contempt and anger, struggling for
mastery with his old and passionate love, his
heart seemed about to rend with its conflicting
emotions.
</p>

<p>
One sensation was ever present&mdash;it was one of
desolation and loneliness&mdash;that he had nothing
more to live for; that the world was all a blank.
The light that had long led him on through so
many miseries and dangers had vanished from his
view: his idol was shattered for ever.
</p>

<p>
He felt that it was impossible to think with
calmness; to tear from his breast the dear image
and the cherished hopes he had fostered there so
long&mdash;to exchange admiration for contempt&mdash;love
for indifference.  Oh, no! it could never be.
Ages seemed to have elapsed since the sun had
set that evening; while his parting with Lilian,
the triumph of Killycrankie, the carnage of
Steinkirke, and his mission from the King, seemed all
the events of yesterday.
</p>

<p>
He felt sick and palsied at heart.
</p>

<p>
Irresistibly impelled to see her, heedless alike
of the dangerous charm of her presence and the
risk he ran if discovered, his whole soul was bent
upon an interview, that he might upbraid her with
her perfidy&mdash;hurl upon her a mountain of reprobation
and bitterness, of obloquy and scorn, and
then leave her presence for ever.
</p>

<p>
"I am alone in the world," thought he.  "This
is my native land&mdash;the land where I had garnered
up my heart, my hopes, and my wishes, though
not one foot of it is mine save the sod that must
cover me.  Of all the tens of thousands that tread
its soil, there is not one now with whom I can
claim kindred, who would welcome me in coming,
or bless me in departing&mdash;not one to shed a tear
on the grave where I shall lie.  Oh! it is very sad
to feel one's self so desolate.  Where now are all
those brave companions with whom I was once so
daring, so joyous, and so gay?  Alas! on a
hundred fields their bones lie scattered, and I
alone survive to mourn the glory of the days that
are gone for ever!  Oh, never more shall the
drum beat or trumpet sound for me!  Oh, never
more shall love or glory fire my heart again!  Oh,
never more, for the hour is passed and never
can return"&mdash;and he almost wept, so intensely
bitter were his thoughts of sorrow and regret.
</p>

<p>
The barbican gate stood ajar, and the old and
well remembered doorway at the foot of the tower
was also open; they seemed to invite his entrance,
and, careless of the consequences, he went
mechanically forward.
</p>

<p>
The old portrait on horseback, the trophy of
arms, and the wooden Flemish clock with its
monotonous <i>tick-tack</i>, still occupied the vaulted
lobby.  Every thing seemed as he had seen them
last.  He turned to the left and entered the
chamber-of-dais, breathless and trembling, for he
seemed instinctively to know that <i>she</i> was there.
</p>

<p>
He entered softly, and, overpowered by the
violence of his conflicting emotions, stood rooted to
the spot.  The old chamber, with its massive
pannelling and rich decorations of the Scoto-French
school was partially lighted by the ruddy
glow from the great fire-place, and by the last
deep red flush of the departed sun that streamed
through its grated windows.
</p>

<p>
The dark furniture, the grotesque cabinets with
their twisted columns, the stark chairs with their
knobby backs and worsted bobs, the grim
full-length of Sir Archibald Napier, cap-a-pie à la
cuirassier, the dormant beam with its load of
lances, swords, and daggers, were all as Walter
had last seen them; but the old lady's
well-cushioned chair, her long walking-cane and ivory
virreled spinning-wheel had long since disappeared;
and hawk's-hoods, hunting horns, spurs,
whips, and stray tobacco pipes lay in various
places, while in lieu of Lady Grisel's sleek and
pampered tom cat, a great wiry, red-eyed, sleuth
hound slept on the warm hearth-rug.  On all this
Walter bestowed not a glance, for his eyes and
his soul became immediately rivetted on the
figure of Lilian.
</p>

<p>
With her head leaning on her hand she sat
within the deep recess of a western window,
and the faint light of the setting sun lit up her
features and edged her ringlets with gold.  She
was absorbed in deep thought.
</p>

<p>
Lilian, who for days, and months, and years, in
health and in sickness, in danger and in safety, in
sorrow and in joy, had never for a moment been
absent from his thoughts, was now before him,
and yet he had not one word of greeting to
bestow.  He seemed to be in a trance&mdash;to be
oppressed by some horrible dream.
</p>

<p>
He observed her anxiously and narrowly.
Nothing could be more tender than the love that
was expressed in his eyes, and nothing more
acute than the agony expressed by his contracted
features.
</p>

<p>
Lapse of years, change of circumstances and of
thought had considerably altered the appearance
of Lilian.  The light-hearted, slender, and joyous
girl had expanded into a stately, grave, and
melancholy matron.  Oh, what a change those five
sad years had wrought!  Her dress was magnificent,
as became the wife of a Scottish noble;
her figure, though still slight, was fuller and
rounder than of old; her face, though still
dignified and beautiful, was paler&mdash;even sickly.  Her
blue eyes seemed to have lost much of their former
brilliancy, and to have gained only in softness of
expression.  Her dark lashes were cast down,
and her aspect was sad and touching.  The
bloom of her lip and her cheek had faded away
together, for heavily on her affectionate heart had
the hand of suffering weighed.
</p>

<p>
She wept, and the heart of Walter was melted
within him.  Had all the universe been his he
would have given it to have embraced her.  He
sighed bitterly, but dared not to approach.
</p>

<p>
"He is gone," said Lilian,&mdash;"gone to spend
another night in riot and debauchery, while I am
left ever alone.  Perhaps 'tis well, for often his
presence is intolerable.  Woe is me!  Oh, how
different was the future I once pictured to my
imagination!"
</p>

<p>
The sound of that dear voice, which had so
often come to him through his dreams in many a
far and foreign camp and city, made Walter
tremble.  He was deeply moved.  The fire in
the arched chimney, which had been smouldering,
now suddenly shot up into a broad and ruddy
blaze that lighted the whole chamber.  Lilian
turned her head, and instantly grew pale as
death, for full on the image of him who occupied
her thoughts&mdash;of Walter Fenton, hollow eyed,
emaciated, and supported on a walking-staff&mdash;fell
the bright stream of that fitful light.  He
looked so unearthly, so motionless and spectral,
that Lilian's blood ran cold.
</p>

<p>
She would have screamed, but the cry died
away upon her lips.  After a moment or two her
spirit rallied; her respiration, though hurried,
became more free; her face blushed scarlet up to
the very temples, and then became ashy pale, as
before, and her glazed eyes resumed their wild
and inquiring expression.  She arose, but neither
advanced nor spoke.  All power seemed to have
left her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lilian!  Lilian!" said the poor wanderer
in a voice of great pathos; "after the lapse of five
long years of exile and suffering, what a meeting
is this for us!  Under what a course of perils
have the hope of my return and your truth not
sustained me?  My God! that I should find you
thus.  Is this the welcome I expected?"
</p>

<p>
Summoning all her courage and that self-possession
which women have in so great a degree,
Lilian (though her eyes were full of tears) averted
her face, and recalled the fatal letter of Finland,
on which had turned the whole of her future fate.
</p>

<p>
"Look at me, adorable Lilian!" said Walter,
kneeling and stretching his arms towards her.
</p>

<p>
Lilian dared not to look; but she trembled
violently and sobbed heavily.
</p>

<p>
"Look at me, beloved one," said Walter
wildly and passionately.  "Changed though I
am, and though another holds your heart, you
cannot have forgotten me, or learned to view me
with aversion and contempt.  If this Lord has
won your affection&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, say not that, Walter," sobbed Lilian
"do not say my affection."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, horror! what misery can equal such an
avowal?  My fatal absence has undone us both."
</p>

<p>
"Say, rather, your fatal inconstancy."
</p>

<p>
"Mine?" reiterated Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, yes; upbraid me not," said Lilian in
a piercing voice.  "I was faithful and true until
you forsook me for another.  To God I appeal,"
she cried, raising her clasped hands and weeping
eyes to Heaven, "kneeling I appeal if ever in
word, or thought, or hope I swerved in truth from
thee, dear Walter, until tidings of your marriage
reached me; when, stung by jealousy, by pride,
by disappointment and despair, and urged by the
unmerited contumely that had fallen upon me, I
yielded to the exhortations of my friends, and
in an evil hour&mdash;&mdash;."  She covered her face
with her hands, and could say no more.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven preserve my senses!" ejaculated
Walter Fenton, "for here the wiles of Hell have
been at work.  We have been deceived, cruelly
deceived, dear Lilian, by some deep-laid plot of
villany which this right hand shall yet unravel and
revenge.  And you are the wife of Clermistonlee?
Hear me, unfortunate!  You are less than&mdash;ah,
how shall I say it?  You are not and cannot be
his wife!"
</p>

<p>
"You rave, poor Walter.  Our doom is irrevocably
sealed.  Our paths in life must be for
ever separate.  Oh, for the love of gentle mercy
begone, and let us meet no more, for at this
moment I feel my brain whirling, and I am
trembling on the very verge of madness."
</p>

<p>
"Lilian, this is the 20th of September," said
Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Cruel, cruel; do not speak of it," said she,
wringing her hands.  "For Heaven's sake leave
me, and take back the pledge&mdash;the ring, for to
retain it longer were a sin, and too long have I
sinned in treasuring it as I have done."
</p>

<p>
Unlocking a cabinet, she drew from a secret
drawer a ring to which a ribbon was attached, and
offered it to Walter; but he never approached.
</p>

<p>
"We have been cruelly duped, dear Lilian;
but oh, how could you doubt me, for never did I
mistrust you?  But hear me, though my words
should crush your heart as mine just now is
crushed.  Alison Gifford, the first wife of Lord
Clermistonlee yet lives, though (as she told me)
dead to him and to the world for ever!"
</p>

<p>
"What new horror is this?" said Lilian, pressing
her hands upon her temples.
</p>

<p>
In a few words her unhappy lover explained
how he had become acquainted with the existence
of Lady Clermistonlee.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is indeed to bruise the bruised&mdash;to
heap brands upon a burning heart," said Lilian,
as she sank into a chair and covered her face with
her hands.  A long pause ensued, till Walter said
in a low and trembling voice,
</p>

<p>
"Lilian, do you really love this man&mdash;this
Clermistonlee?"
</p>

<p>
"He is my husband."
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible you can love him!"
</p>

<p>
"Love him!&mdash;oh, no! custom has in part overcome
the aversion with which I once regarded
him, and by his able flattery he has succeeded in
soothing me into a temper of kind indifference
and quiet resignation&mdash;but oh, this interview&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Walter, who had never dared to diminish the
distance between them, gazed wistfully and
tenderly upon her; but at that moment an infant
that was sleeping in its cradle awoke, and cried
aloud.  Its voice seemed to sting him to the
heart, and he turned abruptly to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, Lilian," said he; "I will go, and
my presence shall disturb your serenity no more.
May you be happy, and may God bless and
forgive you for the agony I now endure!
Clermistonlee, like the matchless villain he has been
through life, has wronged us both; but let him
tremble in the midst of his success and his
treason, for the hour is coming when our King
shall enjoy his own again, and remember that in
that hour the same hand which rends the baron's
coronet from the brow of your betrayer, bestows
on me the Earldom of Dalrulion!  Farewell,"
said he through his clenched teeth; "to me the
paths of ambition and revenge are open still,
though those of happiness and love are closed,
alas, for ever!"  He gave her one long glance of
agony, and turned to depart; but at that moment
strong hands were laid upon him violently&mdash;the
room was filled with soldiers and the beagles of
justice; he was dragged down and bound with
cords, ere he could make the slightest effort in his
own defence.
</p>

<p>
"An out-and-out Jacobite, Papist, and a' the
rest o' it&mdash;I ken by the look o' him!" cried
Maclutchy, the macer, flourishing his badge of
office.  "Here will be some grand plots brought
to light that will bring half the country under
doom o' forfeiture and fine.  Kittle times, lads,
kittle times!'
</p>

<p>
"Away with him!" cried Clermistonlee, spurning
the manacled unfortunate with his foot;
"away with him!  The Lords of the Privy Council
meet in an hour.  Lose no time, for by all the
devils, the corbies of the Burghmuir shall pick
his bones ere the morrow's sun be set."
</p>

<p>
As Walter was roughly dragged away, Lilian
threw her hands above her head, uttered one wild
shriek, and fell forward on her face, motionless as
if dead.
</p>

CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
THE RING AND THE SECRET.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  See the cypress wreath of saddest hue,<br />
  The twining destiny threading through;<br />
  And the serpent coil is twisting there&mdash;<br />
  While regardless of the victim's prayer,<br />
  The fiend laughs out o'er the mischief done,<br />
  And the canker-worm makes the heart his throne.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE PROPHECY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Twelve o'clock tolled heavily and sadly from
the steeple of St. Giles.
</p>

<p>
It was a bleak and cold night.  The Lords of
the Privy Council, muffled up in their well-furred
rocquelaures, with their hats flapped over
their periwigs, ascended from the subterranean
vaults under the Parliament House where they
held their dreaded conclaves, and hurried away to
their residences in the various deep and steep
wynds of the ancient city.  Mersington, who,
overcome by sleep and wine, had remained at the
table until roused by Macer Maclutchy, was the
last to come forth, and he stood rubbing his eyes
in the Parliament Square, and watching the black
gigantic statue of King Charles with steady
gravity, for he could have sworn at that moment
that it seemed to be trotting hard towards him.
His rallying faculties were scattered again by a
stranger violently jostling him.
</p>

<p>
"Haud ye dyvour loon!" exclaimed the incensed
Senator; "I am the Lord Mersington."
</p>

<p>
"And what art doing here, pumpkinhead?"
asked Clermistonlee, who was quite breathless by
having rushed up the Back Stairs, as those flights
of steps which ascended from the Cowgate to the
Parliament Square were named.  "Are the proceedings
over?  Hath the villain confessed?  Is
he to die?"
</p>

<p>
"They are over, and he shall die conform to
the Act."
</p>

<p>
"And how went the proceedings?"
</p>

<p>
"Deil kens; I sleepit the haill time."
</p>

<p>
"Driveller!" cried Clermistonlee in a towering
passion; "'tis like thee; your head is as
empty as my purse&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hee, hee, ye seem a bonnie temper to-night.
But what detained you frae the board, when ye
knew you were principal witness?"
</p>

<p>
"The sudden indisposition of Lady Clermistonlee
made it impossible for me to leave Bruntisfield&mdash;but
I have this moment galloped in from
The Place."
</p>

<p>
"You are a kind and considerate gudeman,"
said Mersington drily.
</p>

<p>
"And what did this fellow confess?"
</p>

<p>
"His abhorrence of you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
"His hatred of the present government, and
his weariness o' this life.  He spoke unco dreich
and sadly, puir callant,&mdash;and sae I fell fast asleep
and dozed like a top."
</p>

<p>
"And did not that goosecap, the King's
Advocate, give him a twinge or two of the
torture?"
</p>

<p>
"We brought some braw things to light without
the help o' rack or screw.  The tails o' his
coat were as fu' o' treason as an egg's fu' o' meat.
There were five and twenty autograph letters
frae the bluidy and papistical Duke James&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stuff!  But lately he was styled His most
Sacred Majesty, by the grace of God, and so
forth."
</p>

<p>
"I speak as we wrote it in the council minutes.
Five and twenty letters to the cut-throat Hieland
chiefs, to the Murrays of Stormont, the Drummonds
and others, some slee tod lowries we have
long had our een on.  But maist of a' was a
notable plot of that d&mdash;&mdash;ned jaud Madame
Maintenon to assassinate King William."
</p>

<p>
"Hah!"
</p>

<p>
"From a paper found, it appears that a certain
Monsieur Dumont is now disguised as a soldier
in our confederate army in Flanders, watching an
opportunity to shoot the King and escape."
</p>

<p>
"By St. George, I hope the aforesaid Monsieur
Dumont is a good shot&mdash;a regular candle-snuffer!"
</p>

<p>
"Our culprit, Fenton, knew not of Maintenon's
plot, or of her papers being among those on his
person.  He looked black dumbfoundered when
Maclutchy drew them frae a neuk in his coat tail."
</p>

<p>
"And to whom were they directed?"
</p>

<p>
"To one <i>Widow Douglas</i>, whilk the King's
advocate avers to be no other than the Lady
Dunbarton.  Fenton grew red with anger on their
being read, and smote his forehead, saying, '<i>Dupe
that I have been! the noble Duc de Chartres
warned me to beware of De Maintenon; but let it
pass:</i>' and here, as I said, I fell fast asleep, until
a minute ago.  But come, let us have a pint of
sack; I am clean brainbraised wi' drouth, and I
warrant Lucky Dreep, in the Kirk-o'-field Wynd,
keeps open door yet."
</p>

<p>
"And he dies?" said Clermistonlee, who could
think of nothing but glutting his revenge.
</p>

<p>
"Early to-morrow morning, by the bullet."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather it had been by the cord.  How
came our considerate councillors to shoot instead
of hang him?"
</p>

<p>
"Soldiers, ye ken, are often soft-hearted when
other men are in stern mood; so auld General
Livingstone, after pleading hard for Fenton's life,
and failing, procured what he called an honourable
commutation of the sentence, for which the puir
gomeral cavalier thanked him as if it had been a
reprieve."
</p>

<p>
"Cord or bullet it matters not.  So perish all
who would cross the purposes of Randal of
Clermistonlee."
</p>

<p>
His Lordship for once resisted the importunities
of his friend, and instead of adjourning to a
tavern, rode slowly and reluctantly back to his own
house.  He felt a strange and unaccountable
presentiment of impending evil, for which he could
not account, but endeavoured to throw it from
him.  The effort was vain.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself a villain.  A load of long
accumulated wickedness oppressed his proud heart; it
was not without its better traits, and writhed as
he reflected on some events in his past life.
</p>

<p>
"Alison!  Alison!" he exclaimed, turning his
dark eyes upwards to the star-studded firmament,
"now thy curse is coming heavily upon me."
</p>

<p>
His principal dread was the death of Lilian, for
he had learned to love her with tolerable
sincerity, but he knew not the secret which Walter
had revealed to her, and the consequent intensity
of her horror, aversion, shame, and anger.  He
knew not the tempest it had raised in her sensitive
breast against him.
</p>

<p>
When he entered the chamber-of-dais she was
seated near a tall silver lamp.  The glare of the
untrimmed light fell full upon her face, and its
ghastly and altered expression struck a mortal
chillness on the heart of her husband.  He said
not a word, but walking straight to a beauffet filled
a large silver cup several times with wine, and
always drained it to the bottom.  The liquor
mounted rapidly to his brain; he threw himself
into a chair opposite Lilian, and heedless of the
perfect scorn that quivered in her beautiful
nostrils, and sparkled in her brilliant eyes, began
leisurely to unbutton his riding gambadoes of red
stamped maroquin, whistling a merry hunting tune
while he did so.
</p>

<p>
It was easier for him to requite scorn with scorn
than give tenderness for love.
</p>

<p>
"Confusion on the buttons!" he exclaimed.
"Juden!  Juden!  Tush, I forgot; poor Juden
hath been with the devil these three years.  There
is none now of all my rascally household who will
share with me the morrow's glut of vengeance as
thou wouldst have done, my faithful Juden."
</p>

<p>
Lilian wrung her attenuated hands;
Clermistonlee regarded her sternly, and then bursting
into a loud laugh, as he threw away his boots and
spurs, chanted a verse from the old black-letter
ballad of Gilderoy:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Beneath the left ear so fit for a cord,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rope so charming a zone is;<br />
  Thy youth in his cart hath air of a Lord,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we cry&mdash;there dies an Adonis!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Ha! ha!  I shall see his head on the Bow
Port to-morrow, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Infamous and wicked!" exclaimed Lilian,
feeling all her old love revived with double ardour,
and no longer able to restrain her sentiments of
grief and indignation.  "Walter, dear and beloved
Walter, how cruelly have I been deceived!" and
drawing from her bosom the ring&mdash;his mother's
ring, the pledge of his betrothal, she pressed it to
her lips with fervour.
</p>

<p>
The brow of the proud Clermistonlee grew
black as thunder, and he grasped her slender arm
with the tenacity of a falcon.
</p>

<p>
"Surrender this bauble, that I may commit it
to the flames.  Surrender it, madam, lest I dash
thee to the earth, for at this moment I feel, by all
the devils, my brain spinning like a jenny."
</p>

<p>
"Give him the ring, Lady Lilian; give it, for
the sight of it will arrest his vision even as the
letters of fire arrested the eyes of Belshazzar and
smote him with dismay.  Sweet lady, let him look
upon it," said the voice of a woman.
</p>

<p>
They turned, and beheld the pale, emaciated,
and haggard visage of Beatrix Gilruth, half shaded
by a tattered tartan plaid.  Taking advantage of
Lilian's momentary surprise, her husband snatched
the ring from her, and was about to hurl it into
the fire, when, incited by the woman's words, and
impelled by some mysterious and irresistible
curiosity, he looked upon it, and the effect of his
single glance acted like magic upon him.  He
quitted his clutch of Lilian's arm, trembled, grew
pale, and turning the ring again and again,
surveyed it with intense curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"How came <i>he</i> to have this ring?" he muttered;
"what strange mystery is here?  If it
should be so&mdash;&mdash;  O, impossible!"
</p>

<p>
He pressed a spring that must have been known
only to himself, for Lilian had never discovered it
in all the myriad times she had surveyed it, and
Walter himself was ignorant of the secret when he
bestowed the trinket upon her.  The lapse of
years had stiffened the spring; but after a
moment's pressure from the finger of Clermistonlee,
a little shield of gold unclosed, revealing a minute
and beautiful little miniature of himself, which in
earlier days had been one of the happiest efforts of
the young Medina's pencil.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas my bridal gift to Alison," he exclaimed
in a voice of confusion and remorse.  "Oh, Alison,
Alison! many have I loved but never one like
thee.  Never again did my heart feel the same
ardour that fired it when I placed this ring on
your adorable hand.  Unfortunate Alison!"
</p>

<p>
"This ring was tied by a ribbon around the
neck of Walter Fenton, when a little child he was
found by the side of his dead mother in the
Greyfriars churchyard," said Lilian in a breathless
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Confusion and misery! 'tis impossible this
can be true; there is some diabolical mistake here.
Woman, say forth."
</p>

<p>
Beatrix gave Clermistonlee a bitter and malicious
smile, and addressed Lilian.
</p>

<p>
"Walter's mother, sweet lady, gave that ring to
Elspat Fenton, who, next to myself, was the most
trusted of her attendants, and bade her travel
from Paris to Scotland, and deliver the child and
the bridal gift together to her husband&mdash;to Randal
of Clermistonlee."
</p>

<p>
Lilian covered her face, and the fiery lord,
whose first emotions were generally those of anger,
surveyed Beatrix as if she had been a coiled up
snake.  She spoke slowly, and made long pauses,
for aware that her words were as daggers, she dealt
them sparingly.
</p>

<p>
"After long suffering and great peril by sea and
land, this poor woman reached Edinburgh, but
failed to meet the father of the infant committed
to her care; for then he was in arms with the men
of the Covenant, hoping by any civil broil or
commotion to repair the splendid patrimony his
excesses had dissipated.  Elspat, being unable to
give a very coherent account of herself, was
declared a nonconformist by the authorities, and
thrown with thousands of others into the Greyfriars
kirkyard, where in that inclement season she
perished; but the child was found and protected
by the soldiers of Dunbarton.  That child is
Walter Fenton; he is your son, Lord Clermistonlee! the
child of your once loved Alison Gilford.  I
call upon Heaven to witness the truth of my
assertion!  His own name was Walter, (ah! can
you have forgotten that?) his nurse's Fenton.  <i>I
saw her die</i>, and I alone knew the secret, and have
treasured it till this hour&mdash;this hour of vengeance
upon thee, thou false and wicked lord!  In my
wicked spirit of revenge too long have I kept the
secret; but now this blameless and noble youth is
doomed to death, and fain would I save him, for
he is innocent, and good, and generous; in all
things, oh, how much the reverse of thee!"
</p>

<p>
"Maniac, thou liest!" exclaimed Clermistonlee,
whose heart beat wildly.  "I cannot believe this
tale of a tub, which is told to affright me.  And
yet, how dare I reject it?&mdash;the ring&mdash;Walter&mdash;my
God!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha! has Beatrix the wronged, the scorned,
the despised, the neglected Beatrix, wrung your
heart at last?  Fool! fool!  Did'st thou never
suspect the volcano that slumbered here?" she
exclaimed, laying her hand upon her heart.
"Did'st thou never perceive the flame that
smouldered in my breast&mdash;the yearnings, the
throbbings, the fierce longing to be adequately
revenged on thee who had brought me to ruin
and madness, and had abandoned me to penury and
privation?  Wretch! 'tis twenty-five years since
ye betrayed me.  Time has rolled on&mdash;time, that
soothes all sorrows and softens every affliction,
and teaches us to forget the wrongs of the
living&mdash;yea, and the virtues of the dead; and perhaps
to wonder why we hated one and loved the
other,&mdash;time, I say, has rolled on to many miserable
years, until I have become the hideous thing I am,
but it never lessened one tithe of my longing for
vengeance for the thousand taunts and contumelies
that succeeded my first sacrifice for thee.
You say I am mad&mdash;perhaps I am&mdash;but mark me&mdash;<i>a
woman's sorrow passes like a summer cloudy
but her vengeance endureth for ever!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee smote his forehead, and Beatrix
laughed like a hyæna.
</p>

<p>
"My God&mdash;unhappy Walter!" said Lilian in
a voice that pierced the heart of him she abhorred
to deem her husband.  "Then she who saved and
nursed thee on the field of Steinkirke was thy
mother&mdash;<i>thy mother</i>, and she knew it not?  Oh,
this was the secret sentiment, the heaven-born
thought that spoke within her and made her heart
so mysteriously yearn towards thee.  Unfortunate
Walter! how deeply have we been wronged&mdash;how
bitterly must we suffer!"
</p>

<p>
"And till now, thou accursed fiend, this
terrible secret has been concealed from me!" said
Clermistonlee furiously, as he half drew his
sword.
</p>

<p>
Beatrix laughed and tossed her arms wildly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, horror upon horror! woe upon woe!"
said Lilian in a voice of the deepest anguish as
she rung her hands, and, taking up her little
infant from the cradle, kissed it tenderly on the
forehead, and retired slowly from the room.
</p>

<p>
"Lilian&mdash;Lilian," cried her husband, "whither
go ye, lady?"
</p>

<p>
"To solitude&mdash;to solitude," she murmured.
"Any where to save me from my own terrible
thoughts&mdash;anywhere to hide me from the deep
disgrace you have brought upon me; to any place
where never again the light of day shall find me."
</p>

<p>
Clermistonlee heard her light steps on the
staircase, and they fell like a knell on his heart:
impelled by some secret and mysterious impulse, he
followed her to her own apartment, the door of
which he had heard close behind her.  There was
no sound within it.
</p>

<p>
He entered softly; but she was not there; and
from that moment she was never beheld again!
Every ultimate search proved fruitless and
unavailing.  A veil of impenetrable mystery hung
over her fate.......
</p>

<p>
A sudden thought flashed on the mind of
Clermistonlee.  The day dawn was breaking as he
descended the staircase, after fruitlessly calling on
Lilian through various apartments.
</p>

<p>
"I may, I must save him yet&mdash;unfortunate
youth, a father's arms shall yet embrace him.  Oh,
my hapless and deeply wronged Alison! fortune
may yet enable me in some sort to repair the
atrocities of which I have been guilty.  My horse! my
horse!" and, rushing to the stable, he saddled
and bridled a fleet steed, and in five minutes was
galloping furiously back to the city, the walls and
towers of which arose before him, red and sombre
in the rays of the morning sun.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
THE IRON ROOM&mdash;THE DEATH SHOT.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Ay, I had planned full many a sanguine scheme<br />
  Of earthly happiness&mdash;romantic schemes,<br />
  And fraught with loveliness:&mdash;and it is hard<br />
  To feel the hand of death arrest one's steps,<br />
  Throw a chill blight o'er all one's budding prospects,<br />
  And hurl one's soul untimely to the shades,<br />
  Lost in the gaping gulph of blank oblivion.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HENRY KIRKE WHITE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Iron Room of the ancient Tolbooth of
Edinburgh was a dreary vault of massive stone-work,
and was named so in consequence of its
strength and security.  A low heavy arch roofed
it, and the walls from which it sprung were
composed of great blocks of roughly hewn stone
elaborately built.  Here and there a chain hung
from them.  The floor was paved, and the door
was a complicated mass of iron bars, locks, bolts,
and hinges.  A single aperture, high up in the
wall, admitted the cold midnight wind through its
deep recess.
</p>

<p>
An iron cruise burned on a clumsy wooden
table, near which sat Walter Fenton the
condemned, with his face covered by his hands and
his mind buried in sad and melancholy thoughts.
</p>

<p>
One bright and solitary star shone down upon
him through the grated window, flashing, dilating,
and shrinking; often he gazed upon it
wistfully&mdash;for it was his only companion&mdash;the partner
or the witness of his solitude and his sorrow.
Once he turned to look upon it&mdash;but it had
passed away.
</p>

<p>
He reflected that never again would he behold
a star shining in the firmament.
</p>

<p>
Sad, bitter, and solitary reflection&mdash;for a few
hours was all that was left him now: and, though
the sands of life were ebbing fast, one absorbing
thought occupied his mind&mdash;that Lilian was false
and his rival triumphant; that all his long
cherished schemes and dreams of love and happiness,
glory and ambition, were frustrated and blasted
irredeemably and for ever.
</p>

<p>
He was to die!
</p>

<p>
The infliction of punishment immediately after
trial was anciently practised in all criminal cases,
and the victim was usually led from the presence
of the judge to the scaffold.
</p>

<p>
Walter had been doomed to death as a traitor,
a raiser of sedition, and a deserter from the
Scottish forces: the last accusation, in support of
which his signed <i>oath of fealty</i> to the Estates of
Scotland, had been produced in council by
General Sir Thomas Livingstone, commander-in-chief
of the army, saved him the dishonour of dying on
the gibbet.
</p>

<p>
The door of the Iron Room was opened stealthily,
and the heavy bolts and swinging chains were
again rattling into their places, when Walter
slowly raised his head.  His eye had become
haggard, and his face was overspread with a
deathly pallor.  The tall spare form of the
Reverend Mr. Ichabod Bummel stood before him,
clad in his ample black coat with its enormous
cuffs and pocket-flaps, his deep waistcoat, and
voluminous grey breeches.  He removed his broad
hat, and smoothed down the long lank hair which
was parted in a seam over the top of his cranium,
and fell straight upon each shoulder.  He did not
advance, but continued to press his hat upon his
breast with both hands, to turn up his eyes and
groan mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"Poor youth!" he began, after two or three
hems; "poor youth! now truly thou lookest like
an owl in the desert, yea, verily, even as one
overtaken in the Slough of Despond.  Now thou
seest how atrocious is the crime of rebellion, and
how bitter its meed.  Now thou seest how wicked
is the attempt to overturn our pure and blessed
Kirk as by law established, and to substitute
anarchy and confusion for peace and brotherly
love, and to involve the innocent with the guilty
in one common destruction.  Ewhow!  O guilty
madness&mdash;O miserable infatuation, that for the
phanton of kingly and hereditary right, would
ruthlessly hurl back the land into the dark abyss
of Popery, restore the abomination of the mass,
and substitute the vile and tyrannical James for
that beloved prince of our own persuasion, now
seated on Britain's triple throne, if not by that
imaginary hereditary right, at least by the laws of
the land, and the voice of those that are above
it&mdash;yea, mark me, youth, above it&mdash;the ministers
of the Gospel.  The pious and glorious William
hath been our Saviour from the devilish practices
of Popery, and the machinations of all those
spurious children of Luther and of Calvin, the
Seekers, the Libertines and Independents, Brownists,
Separatists and Familists, Antitrinitarians,
Arians, Socinians, Anti-Scripturists, Anabaptists,
Antinomians, Arminians, and a myriad other
teachers of heresy and preachers of schism&mdash;whilk,
my brethren&mdash;my brother, I mean&mdash;may Beelzebub
confound!  Oh, youth, how wicked and ungracious
it is in thee to reject the stately Fig-tree with its
sweetness and good fruit, and raise up the ancient
thorn and prickly bramble to reign over us!"
</p>

<p>
"My good sir," replied Walter, "it is but a
poor specimen of Presbyterian charity this, to
come hither to a dismal vault, to heap contumely
on the head of the fallen, to humble one who is
already humbled&mdash;to bruise the bruised.  Good
sir, is it kind or charitable to rail at and exult
over me in this my great distress?"
</p>

<p>
At this unexpected accusation, tears started into
the eyes of Ichabod Bummel, who was really a
good man at heart, though his virtues were sadly
obscured by the fanaticism of the times.
</p>

<p>
"Do not misunderstand me, good youth," he
replied hurriedly; "and do me not this great
injustice.  I come in the most humble and Christian
spirit, to cheer thy last hour in this gloomy
hypogeum, and for that godly purpose have
brought with me a copy of my <i>Bombshell</i>, a most
sweet and savoury comforter to the afflicted
mind."
</p>

<p>
He drew that celebrated quarto from his
voluminous pocket, laid it on the table, and opening
it at certain places, turned down the corners of
the leaves.  He then produced a thick little
black-letter psalm-book, the board of which bore the
very decided impression of a Bothwell-brig bullet;
he adjusted a great pair of round horn spectacles
on his long-hooked nose, and in a shrill voice
began his favourite chant:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I like ane owle in desert am," &amp;c.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So much did he resemble the feathered type of
wisdom, that Walter could scarcely repress a
smile.
</p>

<p>
"Young man, wherefore dost thou not join
with me?" asked the divine, raising his black
eyebrows and looking at Walter alternately under,
over, and through his barnacles.
</p>

<p>
"Reverend sir, I never sung a Psalm in my
life, and really cannot do so now."
</p>

<p>
"I warrant thou canst sing <i>Claver'se and his
Cavaliers</i>, <i>King James's March</i>, <i>Rub-a-Dub</i>, and
other profane ditties and camp-songs of thy
wicked faction and ungodly profession," said
Ichabod reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the deep-mouthed bell of St. Giles,
which seemed to swing immediately above
their heads, gave one long and sonorous toll.
</p>

<p>
"It is the first hour of the last morning I shall
ever spend on earth!" exclaimed Walter, starting
up and striking his fetters together in the bitterness
of his soul.  "Oh, Lilian, Lilian, how little
could we have foreseen of all this!"
</p>

<p>
He wept.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well&mdash;no tears can be more precious than
these," said Mr. Bummel, who thought his
exhortations had begun to prove effectual.  "Soon,
good youth, shalt thou reach the end of this vale
of tears!  Lo! thy bride already waiteth thee,
and these tears&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You deem those of contrition and remorse.
They are <i>not</i>.  I have done nothing to repent of,
or for which I ought to feel contrite.  I never
wronged man nor woman, though many have
wronged me in more than a lifetime can repay.
These tears spring only from bitterness and
unavailing regret.  Have I no hope of pardon?  I
care not for life, but my king and the son of my
king require my services, and could my blood
restore them I would die happy.  Where is old Sir
Thomas Dalyell?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone to a warmer climate than Scotland,"
said Ichabod spitefully.
</p>

<p>
"Sir George of Rosehaugh?"
</p>

<p>
"He is gone where he cannot assist thee."
</p>

<p>
"Where is old Colin of Balcarris?"
</p>

<p>
"Fled no one knows whither."
</p>

<p>
"Where, then, is old Sir Robert of Glenae?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone to his last account with other persecutors."
</p>

<p>
"All then are dead or in exile, and none is left
to be a friend to the poor cavalier."
</p>

<p>
"Save one," said Ichabod, pointing upward.
</p>

<p>
"True, true," replied Walter, and covering his
face with his hands he stooped over the table and
prayed intently.
</p>

<p>
Two o'clock struck, three and four followed, but
still he remained, as Ichabod thought, absorbed in
earnest prayer, and kneeling by his side, the worthy
minister joined with true and pious fervour, till
his patience became quite exhausted.  He stirred
him, and Walter, who had fallen asleep, started up.
</p>

<p>
"Is it time?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast slept well," said the divine,
pettishly; "out of seven hours that were allotted
three have already fled."
</p>

<p>
"My dear and worthy sir, you see how calm
my conscience is.  Perhaps it is hard to die so
young; but for me life has now lost every charm.
Death never has terrors to the brave.  He opens
the gates to a fame and a life that are eternal, and
when the coffin lid is closed, sorrow and jealousy,
envy and woe are excluded for ever.  <i>In four
hours more mine will have closed over me</i>. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
Kingdoms and cities, the trees of the forest, the
lakes, the rocks, and the hills themselves, have all
their allotted periods of existence, and man has
his; for every thing must perish&mdash;all must die and
all must pass away.  Oh, why then this foolish
and unavailing regret about a few years more or
less? &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Front to front and foot to foot I
have often met death on the field of battle, and if
without flinching I have faced the volley of a whole
brigade, that hurled a thousand brave spirits into
eternity at once, shall I shrink from the levelled
musquets of twelve base hirelings of the
Stadtholder? &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Will Lilian ever look on the
grave where this heart moulders that loved her so
long and so well?  Oh no, for now she is the wife
of another&mdash;oh, my God, another!  In all wide
Scotland there is not one to regret me, to shed one
tear for me.  I disappear from the earth like a
bubble on a tide of events, leaving not one being behind
me to recal my memory in fondness or regret."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The great clock of St. Giles struck the hour of
seven.
</p>

<p>
Musquets rattled on the pavement of the
echoing street; the door of the Iron Room opened,
and the gudeman of the Tolbooth presented his
stern and sinister visage.
</p>

<p>
"It is time," he announced briefly.
</p>

<p>
"I am ready," replied Walter cheerfully, and,
with a soldier on each side of him and followed by
the clergyman, he descended the narrow circular
staircase of the prison, and, issuing from an
arched doorway at the foot, found himself at the
end of the edifice.  Here he paused and gazed
calmly around him.
</p>

<p>
An early hour was chosen for his execution,
that few might witness it, for there existed in
Scotland a strong feeling against William's
policy; the massacre of Glencoe, the successive
defeats and heavy expenses of the Dutch wars
rankled bitterly in the minds of the people.
</p>

<p>
The lofty streets were silent and shadowy;
scarcely a footfall was heard in them, and the dun
sunlight of the September morning had not
sufficient heat to exhale the haze of the autumnal
night.
</p>

<p>
A company of Argyle's regiment&mdash;the perpetrators
of the Glencoe atrocity&mdash;clad in coarse
brick-coloured uniform of the Dutch fashion,
were drawn up in double ranks facing inwards on
each side of the doorway.  They stood with their
arms reversed, and each stooped his head on his
hands, which rested on the butt of his musket.
At the head of this lane were four drummers with
their drums muffled and craped, and a plain deal
coffin carried upon the shoulders of four soldiers.
Walter, as he gazed steadily along these hostile
ranks, saw only the sourest fanaticism visible in
every face, and in none more so than that of their
commander, a hard-featured and square-shouldered
personage, with a black corslet under his ample
red coat, and wearing a red feather in his broad
hat.  He introduced himself as&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Major Duncannon, of the godly regiment of
my noble lord Argyle."  Walter bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Duncannon!" he replied; "your name is
familiar to me as being the man who issued the
orders for the massacre of Glencoe."
</p>

<p>
Duncannon gave Walter a steady frown in
reply to his glance of undisguised hostility and
contempt, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I obeyed the royal orders of King William III.,
to whom I say be long life&mdash;and, like thee, may
all his enemies perish from Dan to Beersheba!"
</p>

<p>
"I do not acknowledge him; he hath never
been crowned among us, nor sworn the oath a
Scottish king should swear.  Shame on you, sir,
to rank this false-hearted Dutchman with our brave
King William the Lion.  Shame be on you, sir,
and all your faction," cried Walter, holding up his
fettered hands, while his cheek flushed and his
eyes kindled with energy.  "Let our people
recollect that the last man whose limbs were crushed
to a jelly by the accursed steel boots and grinding
thumbscrews, was subjected to their agonizing
torture by the "merciful" William of Orange&mdash;by
the same wise prince by whose express orders
the bravest of the northern tribes was massacred
in their sleep and in cold blood!  Let our brave
soldiers, when the lash that drips with their blood
is flaying them alive, remember that, like scourging
round the fleet and keelhauling the hapless
mariner, it is an introduction of the same pious
and magnanimous monarch who planned, signed,
and countersigned the mandate for the ruthless
atrocity of Glencoe!  Oh, Scotland, Scotland! disloyal
and untrue to the line of your ancient kings,
how long will you waste your treasure and pour
forth your gallant sons to the Dutch and German
wars of a brutal tyrant, who at once fears and hates
and dreads, though he dare not despise you!  But
the hour is coming," and he shook his clenched
hand and clanked his fetters like a fierce
prophet&mdash;"when war, oppression, exaction, and devastation,
will be the meed of the actions of to-day!"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, traitor!" exclaimed Duncannon,
striking him with the hilt of his sword so severely
that blood flowed from his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Major Duncannon, thou art a coward!" said
Walter, turning his eyes of fire upon him.  "The
brave are ever compassionate and gentle&mdash;but
thou! away, man&mdash;for on thy brow is written the
dark curse which the unavenged blood of Glencoe
called down from the blessed God!"
</p>

<p>
Duncannon turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"Away with him!" he cried.  "Drummers,
flam off&mdash;musqueteers, march!" and the procession
began.
</p>

<p>
The dull rolling of the muffled drums, the
regulated tap of the burial march, and the wailing of
the fifes, now shrill and high, and anon sweet and
low, found a deep echo in Walter's melancholy
breast.  Sorrowful and solemn was the measure
of the Psalm, and he felt his beating heart
soothed and saddened; but he could only
mentally accompany the clergyman who walked
bare-headed by his side, and chaunted aloud while the
soldiers marched.
</p>

<p>
Walter's cheek reddened, for his fearless heart
beat high, and he stepped firmly behind his
coffin, the most stately in all that sad procession,
though marching to that dread strain which a
soldier seldom hears, <i>his</i> own death-march.  The
vast recesses of the great cathedral and the distant
echoes of the central street of the city with all its
diverging wynds, replied mournfully to the roll of
the funeral drums.
</p>

<p>
He whose knell they rung seemed the proudest
there among two hundred soldiers.  Life now had
nearly lost every charm, while religion, courage,
and resignation had fully robbed death of all its
terrors.  Roused by the unusual sound, many a
nightcapped citizen peered fearfully forth from his
lofty dwelling; but their looks of wonder or of
pity were unheeded or unseen by Walter Fenton.
He saw only his own coffin borne before him and
the weapons and the hands by which he was to
die; but his bold spirit never quailed, and he
resolved, with true Jacobite enthusiasm, to fall
with honour to the cause for which he suffered.
</p>

<p>
"Halt!" cried Duncannon, and the coffin rang
hollowly as it was placed beside the square stone
pedestal of King Charles's statue, and Walter
immediately kneeled down within it, confronting
the stern Presbyterians of Argyle's regiment with
an aspect of coolness and bravery that did not fail
to excite their admiration and pity.
</p>

<p>
A sergeant approached to bind up his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, my good fellow," said Walter,
waving him away; "I have faced death too often
to flinch now.  Major Duncannon, draw up your
musqueteers, and I will show you how fearlessly
a cavalier of honour can die."
</p>

<p>
While twelve soldiers were drawn up before
him and loaded their muskets, Walter turned his
eyes for the last time to the glorious autumnal
sun, whose red morning rays were shot aslant
between two lofty piles of building into the
shadowy and gloomy quadrangle formed by the
ancient Parliament House, the Goldsmiths' Hall,
the grotesque piazzas, and the grand cathedral.  He
gave one rapid glance of adieu around him, and
then turned towards his destroyers.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, good youth," said Mr. Bummel, as
the tears of true and heartfelt sorrow trickled
over his long hooked nose.  "Farewell.  When
He from whose hand light went forth over the
land, even as the rays of yonder sun&mdash;when He, I
say, returns in His glory we will meet again.  Till
<i>then</i>, farewell."  Covering his face with his
handkerchief, he withdrew a few paces and prayed with
kind and sincere devotion.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the hoofs of a galloping horse
spurred madly down the adjacent street rang
through the vaults and aisles of the great church.
Walter's colour changed.
</p>

<p>
A reprieve!
</p>

<p>
Alas! it was only Lord Clermistonlee who,
pale, panting, and breathless, dashed into the
square to stay the execution; but the cry he
would have uttered died away on his parched
lips.
</p>

<p>
"He comes to exult over me," said Walter
bitterly.  "Behold, ignoble Lord," he exclaimed,
"how a true cavalier can die!  Musqueteers," he
added, in his old voice of authority, "ready, blow
your matches, present, God save King James the
Seventh! give fire!"
</p>

<p>
The death volley rang like thunder in the still
quadrangle.  Four bullets flattened against the
statue, eight were mortal, and with the last
convulsive energy of death Walter Fenton threw his
hat into the air and fell forward prostrate into his
coffin a bleeding corpse.
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here ends our tale.
</p>

<p>
From that hour Clermistonlee was a changed
man.  Though given up to dark, corroding care
and moody thoughts, he lived to a great old age,
and was one of those who sold his country at the
union.  Soon after that event he died, unregretted
and unrespected, and a defaced monument in the
east wall of the Greyfriars Churchyard still marks
the place where he lies.
</p>

<p>
His gossip, Mersington, would no doubt have
obtained a comfortable share of "the compensations"
in 1707 had he not (as appears from a
passage in Carstairs' State Papers) unluckily been
found dead one night in the severe winter of 1700,
with a half-drained mug of burnt sack clutched in
his tenacious grasp.
</p>

<p>
A few words more of Lilian, and then we part.
</p>

<p>
From the moment in which, with her child in
her arms, she ascended the great staircase of
Bruntisfield, she was never again seen.
</p>

<p>
Every place within the mansion and without,
the woods, the lake, the fields, the muir were
searched, but the lady and her child were seen no
more.
</p>

<p>
An impenetrable mystery cast a veil of horror
over their fate; but Mr. Ichabod Bummel, and the
most learned divines of a kirk that was then in
the zenith of its wisdom and power, gave it as
their decided opinion that they had been spirited
away by the fairies; an idea that was unanimously
adopted by the people; nevertheless, a pale spectre,
wailing and pressing a ghastly babe to its attenuated
breast, was often visible on moonlight nights,
among the old oak trees, the rocky heron shaws of
the Burghmuir, or the reedy rhinns of its beautiful
loch, and this terrible fact was solemnly averred
and duly sworn to by various decent and sponsible
men, such as elders and deacons of the kirk, who
chanced to journey that way after nightfall.
</p>

<p>
In latter years it was to the long gloomy avenue
or immediate precincts of the ancient house, that
this terrible tenant confined her midnight promenades.
</p>

<p>
Many sceptical persons, notwithstanding the
assertions of the aforesaid elders and deacons,
declared the story of the apparition to be
downright nonsense.  Many more may be disposed to
do so at the present day; but we would beg them
to withold their decision until they have consulted
as carefully as we have done, the MSS. Session
Records of Mr. Bummel's kirk, entered in his own
hand, and attested by the said elders and deacons
at full length.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1800, when the stately and venerable
mansion of Bruntisfield was demolished, to make
way for the Hospital of Gillespie, within a deep
alcove, or labyrinth of stone, in the heart of its
massive walls, the skeletons of a female and child
were discovered; some fragments of velvet,
brocade, and a gold ring were found with them.
</p>

<p>
On touching them, they crumbled into
undistinguishable dust.
</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
